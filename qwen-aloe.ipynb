      "[patient] okay .\n",
      "[doctor] let's go ahead , i wan na look at some of your results , okay ? hey , dragon , show me the echocardiogram . so , this is the result of the echocardiogram that we did last year . it showed that you have that low-ish pumping function of your heart at about 45 % . and it also sh- shows some mitral regurgitation , that's that heart murmur that i heard , okay ?\n",
      "[doctor] um , hey , dragon , show me the lipid panel . so , looking at your lipid panel from last year , you know , everything , your cholesterol was like , a tiny bit high . but it was n't too , too bad , so i know you're trying to watch your diet . so , we'll repeat another one this year , okay ?\n",
      "[patient] okay .\n",
      "[doctor] um , so i wan na just go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you , okay ? so , for your first problem your congestive heart failure , um , i wan na continue you on your current medications . but i do wan na increase your lisinopril to 40 milligrams a day , just because your blood pressure's high . and you know , you are retaining a little bit of fluid . i also wan na start you on some lasix , you know , 20 milligrams a day . and have you continue to watch your , your diet , okay ?\n",
      "[patient] okay .\n",
      "[doctor] i also wan na repeat another echocardiogram , okay ?\n",
      "[patient] all right .\n",

      "[patient] no , i feel the same way .\n",
      "[doctor] okay , all right . and then for your last problem your hypertension , you know , again i , i , i think it's out of control . but we'll see , i think , you know , i'd like to see you take the lisinopril as directed , okay ? uh , i want you to record your blood pressures within the patient , you know , take your blood pressure every day . record them to me for like , about a week , so i have to see if we have to add another agent , okay ? 'cause we need to get that under better control for your heart failure to be more successful , okay ?\n",
      "[patient] okay .\n",
      "[doctor] do you have any questions ? , and i forgot . for your annual exam , you're due for a mammogram , so we have to schedule for that , as well , okay ?\n",

      "[doctor] yeah . you can certainly take them , you know , all at the same time , as long , as yeah , they're all one scale . you can take them all at the same time . just set an alarm-\n",
      "[patient] okay .\n",
      "[doctor] . some time during the day to take them , okay ?\n",

      "[doctor] patrick allen , date of birth 7/7/1977 . new patient visit . past medical history includes gerd , anxiety , depression , here for chronic abdominal pain , he had an abdominal ct on 1/23/2020 . impression is a normal ct of the abdomen . hello , are you mr. allen ? [patient] yes , i am . [doctor] hi , my name is dr. edwards , nice to meet you . [patient] nice to meet you . [doctor] welcome to the gi specialty clinic . [patient] thank you . [doctor] did you have any problems finding this ? [patient] no , i've been here with my sister once before . [doctor] good , so how can i help you today ? the referral i have is for abdominal pain and diarrhea . [patient] right so i've had been having this pain right here in my stomach like right around here . [doctor] so in the area of your mid abdomen just below the belly button ? [patient] correct . i've had the pain on and off for about 2 years . i finally went to the er and a a few months ago and they did a ct scan . [doctor] i saw that . [patient] yeah , they said they did n't really see anything on the scan . [doctor] yes , i agree , it looked normal . [patient] and the problem is i'm either constipated or have explosive diarrhea . [doctor] is the pain there all the time ? [patient] it's a nagging feeling and it just depends , sometimes it bothers me , sometimes it does n't . [doctor] has this been the case over the past 2 years as well ? [patient] more recently in the past couple of months at least with the constipation and diarrhea . [doctor] and before that , how were your bowel movements ? [patient] they were normal . [doctor] okay , so any blood in your stool ? [patient] nope . [doctor] do you feel like you have more constipation or diarrhea ? [patient] probably more constipation . [doctor] okay , so when you're constipated , do you not have a bowel movement or is the stool hard ? [patient] i usually do n't go , but when i do , it's hard . [doctor] and how often do you have a bowel movement when you are constipated ? [patient] about 3-4 times a week it's like when i need to go to the bathroom if i can massage it , it feels like it's moving some and i can eventually go . [doctor] okay and when you have a bowel movement , does the pain change ? [patient] yeah . it gets a little better . [doctor] and are you eating and drinking okay , any nausea or vomiting , heartburn or indigestion ? [patient] none of that . [doctor] okay , so tell me about the diarrhea . how often do you get it ? [patient] it kinda just depends on what i eat . i think i have a very sensitive stomach if i eat pasta with a creamy sauce i'm probably gon na have diarrhea . [doctor] okay and does it happen for multiple days in a row or is it just one time ? [patient] it's usually just one time and then it's over . [doctor] and how has your weight been , any fluctuation ? [patient] no , it's been pretty stable , although i could stand to lose about 25 pounds . [doctor] okay , and is there any family history of gi issues that you know of ? [patient] not that i can think of . well , actually my sister does have problems with her stomach too . she has irritable bowel syndrome and that is kind of what i always thought i had even though i have never been diagnosed with it . [doctor] okay and is there any family history of gi cancer or liver disease ? [patient] no . [doctor] have you ever had any surgeries on your abdomen ? [patient] i have never had any surgery . [doctor] okay , so your gallbladder , appendix , all of those are still intact ? [patient] yep . [doctor] and have you ever had a colonoscopy ? [patient] no . i thought that happened when you turned 50 . [doctor] well that's for colon cancer screening , but there are other reasons to have a colonoscopy like unexplained abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits . [patient] okay . [doctor] well , come have a seat here and lay back so i can examine you . [patient] okay . [doctor] i'm gon na start by listening to your belly with my stethoscope . [patient] okay . [doctor] and i hear bowel sounds in all four quadrants . [patient] what does that mean , is everything okay ? [doctor] it just means that i can hear little noises in all areas of your belly , which means your bowels are active and working . [patient] okay , good . [doctor] so now i'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen , let me know if you have any pain . [patient] it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side near my belly button . [doctor] okay , i do feel stool in your lower colon which would coincide with constipation but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ? [patient] yes . i had a physical about 4 months ago and they i had blood drawn then . [doctor] okay and did your primary care physician say anything about the lab results ? [patient] he said i had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes but we would recheck them in about 6 months . [doctor] and do you remember what enzymes were elevated , alt , ast , alp ? [patient] he said the alt and the ast were elevated . [doctor] and do you take any medications either prescription or over the counter ? [patient] i take crestor and , and olmesartan daily and then tylenol for occasional , occasional pain . [doctor] and how frequently do you take the tylenol ? [patient] hardly ever , maybe once a month . [doctor] and do you consume alcohol ? [patient] yes , but only a couple of beers after working in the yard on saturdays . [doctor] okay and no previous history of heavy alcohol or drug use ? [patient] no . [doctor] and have you had any recent issues with excessive bruising or bleeding ? [patient] nope . [doctor] and how about any issues with your ankles or feet swelling ? [patient] no . [doctor] okay , i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice . [patient] what would cause that ? [doctor] issues with your liver . let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs . [patient] okay . [doctor] lungs are clear bilateral . heart sounds are normal . no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted . [patient] that's good . [doctor] yes , the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly . [patient] what's that ? [doctor] increased stool burden means that there is a lot of stool sitting in your colon . [patient] and that's the constipation , right ? but what about the other thing ? [doctor] the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged . [patient] but you said mom was slightly enlarged . [doctor] correct . [patient] so what does that mean ? [doctor] well , let's talk about what we found and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement . [patient] okay . [doctor] so as i said , the hepatomegaly means your liver is enlarged . [patient] could that be why my stomach is hurting and i'm having issues with the constipation and diarrhea ? [doctor] no , i think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat and we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that . [patient] so what about my liver , why is it enlarged ? [doctor] well , there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also an enlarged liver . some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to the liver . alcohol abuse , fatty liver disease , hepatitis , cirrhosis , and other liver diseases like wilson's disease . [patient] so what do i need to do ? [doctor] well , i think since it's been about 4 months since your blood work was done , we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs . [patient] okay and then what ? [doctor] we will get those drawn today and then depending upon the results , you may need an ultrasound of your liver . i think we need to talk about your medications too . [patient] which medications ? [doctor] crestor , how long have you been taking that ? [patient] about 18 months . [doctor] okay , well crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity , so it may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives . [patient] should i talk to my primary care or can you change it ? [doctor] i would recommend calling your primary care and discuss that with him since he follows you for your blood pressure and cholesterol . [patient] okay . i'll call him this afternoon . [doctor] great . i also think we should go ahead and get you scheduled for a liver ultrasound . if your blood work looks good , then we can always cancel that . [patient] okay . when do you think i'll be able to get the ultrasound done ? [doctor] hopefully within the next 2 weeks , you will receive a call from the radiology scheduling this afternoon to get it set up . [patient] okay and then what happens ? [doctor] when i get the results from the tests , i'll contact you and depending upon what we find , we'll come up with our next steps . [patient] and when should i see you again ? [doctor] let's schedule an appointment when you check out to return in 4 weeks . we'll discuss how you're doing with the fiber supplement and your constipation and review test results to determine if we need to do further testing on your liver . [patient] okay . is there anything else i can do to help with these issues ? [doctor] definitely refrain from drinking any alcohol , increase your water intake to at least 48 ounces a day , in addition to taking the fiber supplement to help with your constipation and be mindful of eating foods that you are sensitive to so you can avoid the bouts of diarrhea . [patient] okay and i will talk to my primary care about my crestor . [doctor] excellent and do you have any other questions for me ? [patient] i do n't think so . [doctor] great . so remember when you check out at the front desk , schedule a follow-up appointment with me for 4 weeks and then go to the lab to get your blood work drawn . [patient] okay , sounds good . [doctor] and expect a call from radiology scheduling about setting up your ultrasound . [patient] alright . thanks dr. edwards . [doctor] thank you mr. allen .\n"

      "[doctor] same thing okay so you do have a bilateral positive tinel's sign so so here's here's where i'm at i think your your diagnosis is beginning to have some bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome usually we see that with repetitive actions such as the landscaping the heavy labor and you you know your your clinical exam and and history sound like it's a carpal tunnel syndrome i do want to order so where are we gon na go from here i would like to order a a study it's called an emg where it it measures some of that electrical impulses down into your fingers we will follow up with that but as far as your treatment so the treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is really some activity modification now i know you are a landscaper is there any way that you could be work to have some lighter work during the time\n",
      "[patient] i suppose i could try to pass it off to some of my other employes and delegate\n",

      "[patient] no\n",
      "[doctor] okay we'll start with skin testing and we'll see if we can target what the triggers in hopes in hopes that we can avoid any any other management and this can be successful if we ca n't figure out what it is from that we'll have to discuss more testing in your blood and do immunotherapy so i wan na see you next week to schedule the skin testing do you have any questions for me\n",

      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n",
      "Charles Sullivan is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of shortness of breath. The onset of his symptoms began 2 years ago. He has noticed that his breathing is not what it used to be. He describes an increased need to catch his breath. The patient also reports he gets “mid-shortness of breath” without reason. He has been seen at an urgent care where he received a nebulizer treatment and was prescribed an inhaler, which he uses when his symptoms are present. The patient states his symptoms are aggravated by living with a cat in his house and are present even when the cat is not around or is outside. He has experienced epiphora with rheum present that he attributes to allergies. He has had diarrhea after consuming large amounts of alcohol. He denies any symptoms at this time including shortness of breath, rash, nausea, vomiting, and lip or throat swelling. The patient denies any previous issues with allergies.\n",

      "After reviewing the patient's examination, radiographic findings, and pulmonary function test results today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. He will continue to use the albuterol inhaler; however, he should limit its use to when he is experiencing a severe flare-up of symptoms. I advised he should take it as soon as he starts to feel any symptoms at all. I have also prescribed the patient Singulair 10 mg to be taken once daily. This should help to decrease the occurrences of his asthma. I have also recommended we proceed with an allergy skin test to target what his triggers are in the hope that we can avoid any other management. If we unable to determine his allergens, then we may consider further testing or immunotherapy.\n",

She was admitted to the hospital due to her worsening condition. The patient reported feeling weak and sick for the past two weeks. She was given physical therapy, which included educating her about dyspnea-relieving positions and the importance of regular mobilization and deep-breathing exercises. However, her anxiety from fear of dying and worries about her future made her dyspnea worse. After receiving education and relaxing breathing exercises, her respiratory rate decreased from 30 breaths/min to 22 breaths/min, and her oxygen saturation increased from 92% to 96% on 4 L/min oxygen. She regained her self-confidence and was able to walk 350 m without a walking aid or supplemental oxygen before her discharge home. No specific treatment plan, medications, surgeries, or lifestyle changes were mentioned in the conversation.
