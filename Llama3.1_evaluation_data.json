The patient also reports he gets “mid-shortness of breath” without reason. He has been seen at an urgent care where he received a nebulizer treatment and was prescribed an inhaler, which he uses when his symptoms are present. The patient states his symptoms are aggravated by living with a cat in his house and are present even when the cat is not around or is outside. He has experienced epiphora with rheum present that he attributes to allergies. He has had diarrhea after consuming large amounts of alcohol.

I advised he should take it as soon as he starts to feel any symptoms at all. I have also prescribed the patient Singulair 10 mg to be taken once daily. This should help to decrease the occurrences of his asthma. I have also recommended we proceed with an allergy skin test to target what his triggers are in the hope that we can avoid any other management. If we unable to determine his allergens, then we may consider further testing or immunotherapy.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nThe patient will follow up with me in 1 week for skin testing."

you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden\r\n[patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach\r\n[doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics\r\n[patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet\r\n[doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you\r\n[patient] i do n't recall the name exactly\r\n[doctor] do n't recall alright\r\n[patient] something i had taken it before\r\n[doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it\r\n[patient] i'm sorry\r\n[doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot\r\n[patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance\r\n[doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt\r\n[patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] i have n't had that before\r\n[doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled\r\n[patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time\r\n[doctor] okay do you\r\n[patient] i'm not really sure how\r\n[doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it\r\n[patient] i think they told me it was around ten\r\n[doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt\r\n[patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct\r\n[doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening\r\n[patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me\r\n[doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound\r\n[patient] that sounds great\r\n[doctor] alright do you have any other question\r\n[patient] i do if anything happens in between\r\n[doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or

two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past unchanged from before so that's not really worried about that your belly exam is good on your ankle exam on your left ankle you do have some tenderness over the lateral malleolus and you do also have some tenderness over this bone here which is the fifth metatarsal so i do n't see any there is some swelling there some redness but there is some pain with valgus stressing of your ankle as well and let me turn off my phone here and also you do have otherwise normal sensation normal pulses so on your so my diagnosis for your ankle

na go ahead and get an x-ray i'm gon na put you in a splint we're gon na put you in a in an air splint and i'll give you some crutches until i get the x-ray back i want you to do just avoid weightbearing just to make sure there is no fracture there i will give you some naprosyn five hundred milligrams twice a day for pain control keep it elevated put some ice on it i think those are all good things and if the x-ray shows a fracture i'm gon na go ahead and give you a call back and we'll send you to orthopedics but right now let's try this air splint if there is no fracture i will probably have you take off the air splint and do some partial weightbearing and see how it goes does that sound like a reasonable plan for you\r\n[patient] that's a great plan i need to get back to exercising so\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] thank you\r\n[doctor] perfect and for the diabetes keep the eye appointment that you already have you know continue with the metformin i'm gon na order

    "reference": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\r\n\r\nWayne Jenkins is a pleasant 43-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right foot wound, onset 2 to 3 weeks ago. He was seen by his primary care physician who referred him to our office. His last visit with a podiatrist was 2 years ago, however they moved, and he has been unable to get another podiatrist. He denies any specific injury.\r\n\r\nThe patient purchased a new pair of shoes and was breaking them in prior to traveling. Initially, he did not feel that the shoes were too tight, however a blister formed on his right foot. The patient does have neuropathy and notes this might be why he did not notice the tightness. His blister soon became a wound and he was seen by his PCP. He was placed on a round of antibiotics, which he completed yesterday. He denies any changes to the appearance of the wound. The patient denies pain or drainage. His sock will occasionally stick to his wound, regardless of if he has a Band-Aid covering it. The patient has discontinued the use of these shoes. Occasionally, he has issues with stability, which was a primary purpose of purchasing these shoes. He denies any fever or chills.\r\n\r\nRegarding his diabetes, his last hemoglobin A1C was 8.\r\n\r\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\r\n\r\nConstitutional: Denies fever and chills.\r\nSkin: Reports right foot wound.\r\nNeurological: Reports neuropathy.\r\n\r\nVITALS\r\n\r\nTemperature: 98.1.\r\nHeart rate: 72.\r\nRespiration: 16.\r\nBlood pressure: 110/65 mm Hg.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL EXAM\r\n\r\nCV: Palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses. No palpable DP or PT pulses but Doppler signs are present. No evidence of fluid collection.\r\nSKIN: On the right foot, there is a 1 x 2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot that is just proximal to the 5th MTP joint. There is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue. No surrounding erythema or cellulitis. No necrosis. No odor.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\n3 views of the right foot were taken today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis.\r\n\r\nASSESSMENT\r\n\r\n1. Right foot diabetic ulcer.\r\n2. Diabetes.\r\n\r\nPLAN\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. At this time, I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index ABI to determine the blood supply to his foot to see if he can heal this wound. I have also performed a debridement in the office to remove some of the dead tissue. I have prescribed a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound 1 time daily and instructed him to cover with a dry sterile dressing. He will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and the nice pink tissue is present. I have also recommended that the patient be placed in a surgical shoe to take pressure off the area. I do not think that antibiotics are needed at this time. He may need to see a vascular specialist if the ABI indicates that his blood supply is not optimal for wound healing.\r\n\r\nRegarding his diabetes, I explained the need for controlling his diabetes and the effects this will have on wound healing. I have recommended a diabetic consultation to discuss diet modifications to bring his hemoglobin A1c to a better level.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nThe patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress."

    "source": "[doctor] hey william so i see that you injured your knee could you tell me a bit about what happened\r\n[patient] yeah i thought it was a good idea to go to the trampoline park with my wife and heard a snap and instant pain when i was on the trampoline\r\n[doctor] okay alright and so do do you go to the trampoline park often\r\n[patient] i do n't and i think that's the issue\r\n[doctor] okay so this is the first time you'd ever done something like that\r\n[patient] yes\r\n[doctor] okay alright i just wan na get like a few more details do you like work out regularly was this for fun or for like an exercise class\r\n[patient] no it's just for fun\r\n[doctor] okay and do you have like a regular exercise regimen at all\r\n[patient] try to not consistent with it\r\n[doctor] okay no that's fine this is not a place of judgment i just i'm just trying to understand like if a little bit more of the background okay so we went to the trampoline park which knee where did you hurt\r\n[patient] my right\r\n[doctor] okay your right knee and so based on like your inside and outside which part hurts more\r\n[patient] it's kind of the outside of the knee\r\n[doctor] alright so the lateral aspect not a problem and you said that you heard a pop when you landed right\r\n[patient] yeah\r\n[doctor] okay have you taken anything for the pain\r\n[patient] just tylenol\r\n[doctor] alright so did the tylenol help\r\n[patient] not really\r\n[doctor] okay alright and so hmmm when does it have you tried anything else like did you ice it use heat anything like that\r\n[patient] no i just kinda elevated it and that was about it\r\n[doctor] okay that's fine and how long ago did this happen\r\n[patient] a week ago\r\n[doctor] okay alright so you put up with the pain for a week that's i'm proud of you for that\r\n[patient] i do n't like to come to the doctors\r\n[doctor] excuse me i feel rejected right now why why would you say something like that it's fine but you know i i like it when you're not here either because that means that you're doing a good job so let's see about like getting your knee fixed up but i want to talk about some of the other issues that you have first so we know that you have hypertension right and i discussed maybe you getting a blood pressure cuff because i needed you to measure those a bit more regularly did you get the cuff\r\n[patient] what no\r\n[doctor] no okay that's fine have you measured your blood pressure recently at all\r\n[patient] no\r\n[doctor] okay are you still taking your medication because i see you're on twenty milligrams of lisinopril\r\n[patient] yeah most days i remember\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] ra i'm not suspicious but we're just gon na go with that okay because looking at your vitals it it is of still a bit high i'm not really comfortable i see like a hundred and eighty over you know eighty and\r\n[doctor] that's not where we wan na be so i wonder if we might need to adjust your medication but let's talk about your diabetes how are your blood sugars\r\n[patient] i think they're little bit better\r\n[doctor] okay what makes you think that have you been taking them\r\n[patient] yeah i check it you know most days again kinda when i remember\r\n[doctor] okay how often are you checking it\r\n[patient] i would say four five times a week\r\n[doctor] okay you might wan na switch to maybe two or three times a day but you know that's something i'm glad that you are measuring are you taking your metformin\r\n[patient] yes\r\n[doctor] okay and then i think we have you on five hundred milligrams correct\r\n[patient] yes\r\n[doctor] alright how is your diet\r\n[patient] kinda the same as my exercise decent could be better\r\n[doctor] alright and okay not a problem so what is your do you are you measuring your calories at all looking at your macros are you just eating what you feel like\r\n[patient] yeah just trying to watch what i eat more than anything but nothing specific\r\n[doctor] okay and are you do you know if you're particularly focused on your salt like is it like a low salt diet\r\n[patient] no just trying to watch my carbs a little bit more but not counting or anything\r\n[doctor] alright so like is it a specific diet i just wan na make sure like are you on like the keto diet\r\n[patient] no\r\n[doctor] okay alright not a problem so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam as i mentioned before your blood pressure is a little high as i listen to your heart i do like it's got a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur when i listen to your lungs they sound clear bilaterally i would like to look at your knee though so when i press here on the outside does it hurt\r\n[patient] little bit\r\n[doctor] okay and then when i press on the inside does it hurt\r\n[patient] no\r\n[doctor] alright can you bend your knee and straighten it\r\n[patient] i can i think that's all i can i can bend\r\n[doctor] mm-hmm alright so are you having problems walking can you bear weight\r\n[patient] i can but i have a little bit of a limp\r\n[doctor] okay so do you mind getting up and walking for me really quickly alright so i do notice that there is a slight gait like there is a small sorry you are correcting you do have a limp i i am a little worried about that but it's probably it's probably the superficial when i'm looking at your knee i do notice some like ecchymosis and edema that just means bruising and swelling along the lateral aspect of your knee i do n't notice any effusion and it looks like you have a decent range of motion but i do understand that you know you are experiencing pain with some movement okay i'm gon na go ahead and order an x-ray and when you come back we can have that discussion alright so i reviewed the results of your right knee x-ray which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality so let's talk about my assessment and plan alright so for your first problem of right knee pain i think you have a lateral a lateral ligament strain i wan na prescribe some meloxicam which is gon na be fifteen milligrams daily for pain and swelling i'm gon na refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles around the area and to prevent further injury if you're still having pain we can do further imaging imaging but like this is a common injury that tends to heal on its own for your second problem with hypertension i wan na continue the lisinopril at twenty milligrams and order an echo i am concerned that we might not be getting your blood pressure to where we need it to be so we might have to do some medication modification for your third problem with diabetes i wan na order an a1c i know that you said

    "reference": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\r\n\r\nRight knee injury.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\r\n\r\nWilliam Russell is a pleasant 57-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes.\r\n\r\nApproximately 1 week ago, the patient sustained an injury to his right knee while at a trampoline park. He explains that he was jumping on a trampoline when he heard a snap, followed by instant pain in the lateral aspect of his knee. This is not a common activity for him, and he admits that he is inconsistent with exercise. As far as treatment, he has been elevating his knee and taking Tylenol without significant relief of his pain. He has not tried applying heat or ice to the area.\r\n\r\nIn terms of his hypertension, the patient admits that he did not purchase a blood pressure cuff as previously recommended. While he does not monitor his blood pressures at home, he has been compliant with lisinopril 20 mg.\r\n\r\nHis diabetes appears to be stable based on home monitoring, although he is only checking his blood glucose levels 4 to 5 times per week. He does not follow any specific diet plan, but he does try to make healthier choices such as limiting his carbohydrate intake. He has also been taking his metformin 500 mg as prescribed.\r\n\r\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\r\n\r\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain.\r\n\r\nVITALS\r\n\r\nBlood pressure: 180/80 mmHg\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL EXAM\r\n\r\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs.\r\nRESPIRATORY:\r\nLungs are clear bilaterally.\r\nMSK: Examination of the right knee: Mild tenderness to palpation at the lateral aspect. Ecchymosis and edema along the lateral aspect. No effusion. Decent range of motion. Pain with movement.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nX-rays of the right knee were obtained and reviewed. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.\r\n\r\nASSESSMENT\r\n\r\n1. Right knee pain, lateral ligament strain.\r\n2. Hypertension.\r\n3. Diabetes type 2.\r\n\r\nPLAN\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, his symptoms appear to be consistent with a lateral ligament strain of the right knee. I am going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily for pain and swelling. I also put in a referral for physical therapy so he can work on strengthening the muscles around the area and prevent any further injury. We can consider further imaging if he continues to have pain, but I explained that this is a common injury that typically heals on it's own.\r\n\r\nFor his hypertension, I'm concerned that his blood pressure is not well controlled at this time, so we may need to modify his medication. I'm going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation, but I want him to continue taking his lisinopril 20 mg for now.\r\n\r\nFor his diabetes, he stated that he has been measuring his blood glucose levels 4 to 5 times per week, but I want him to start measuring them 2 to 3 times per day. His hemoglobin A1c levels should provide more detail as far as his long-term progress so we will order that today. I'm also going to order a lipid panel and we can determine if any adjustments need to be made to his medication. In the meantime, he should continue taking metformin 500 mg.\r\n"

do n't like the weather you know i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse\r\n[doctor] okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there\r\n[patient] well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time\r\n[doctor] so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version\r\n[patient] well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden\r\n[doctor] okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at\r\n[patient] yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month\r\n[doctor] okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes\r\n[patient] yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here\r\n[doctor] okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me\r\n[patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg\r\n[doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life\r\n[patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten\r\n[doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better\r\n[patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today\r\n[doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs\r\n[patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well\r\n[doctor] that's okay\r\n[patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day\r\n[doctor] absolutely\r\n[patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them\r\n[doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here\r\n[patient] no it's right here\r\n[doctor] okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there\r\n[patient] it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks\r\n[doctor] okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please\r\n[patient] okay that's it that's all i got\r\n[doctor] alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan\r\n[patient] sure sounds good\r\n[doctor] alright sounds good i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and then we'll get that injection for you",
    "reference": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\r\n\r\nMatthew Hill is a pleasant 44-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of back pain. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 30 years ago, when he fell off of a roof. He endorses that it was very bothersome and he was unable to play football. He states that he was told that he may have a fracture at that time. The patient reports that his pain has worsened 1 month ago. He locates his pain to his lower back, which radiates into his left hip, down his left leg, on the side of his calf, and into his left big toe. The patient describes his pain as an \"electrical tooth ache\" that radiates down his entire left leg. He notes that he has to use a cane to walk as his left foot drags when he walks. He rates his pain level as a 6 to 8 out of 10, however it can get to a 13 out of 10 at its worst. He states that he did not take any medication before his appointment so it did not affect his pain during our visit. The patient notes that he was in the waiting room for 30 minutes today and states that it made his symptoms worse. His pain is aggravated by standing, ambulating, coughing, and sneezing. The patient states that he is unable to tie his shoes secondary to the pain. The patient states that his pain is alleviated by lying down. He also reports weakness in his bilateral legs and his back. The patient denies any numbness or tingling. The patient has attempted NSAIDs in the past without relief. He has also attended physical therapy.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL EXAM\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL: Vitals look good.\r\nMSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No bony abnormalities. No redness. No bruising present. Pain with palpation at the L4 vertebrae. Positive for pain with flexion and extension of the back. 4/5 strength on the left, 5/5 strength on the right. Reflexes are brisk. Motor and sensory are intact throughout the bilateral lower extremities.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nThe MRI of the lumbar spine was reviewed today. It revealed a disc herniation at the level of the L4-5 vertebrae. It is associated with some nerve root impingement.\r\n\r\nASSESSMENT\r\n\r\nAcute disc herniation at L4-5 with nerve root impingement.\r\n\r\nPLAN\r\n\r\nI have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with a epidural steroid injection and formal physical therapy.

hands or feet or your face\r\n[doctor] no i have n't\r\n[patient] okay so you you like to run a lot what kind of do you do you use a a good shoe you know what kind of shoes do you use for your running\r\n[doctor] yeah i yeah i i'm starting to get back into it i'm a big new balance person in asics so yeah those are the two brands i like to wear yeah so right now i'm using asics\r\n[patient] okay yeah i like to run too and i use nike\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] i used to get tumor guy but i i really kinda moved over to nike\r\n[doctor] hmmm\r\n[patient] that's good you know it is running is a great exercise\r\n[doctor] it is\r\n[patient] so have you had any let's get back to the exam here have you had a recent mri of your brain i saw one from a few years ago but as doctor white said anything about getting a more a recent mri\r\n[doctor] yeah she was gon na put one in but she wanted me to see you first and urgently so they have n't called me yet for the mri\r\n[patient] okay so that's good we i think we'll we will follow up with that mri but let's go ahead and take a do a quick physical exam here i reviewed your vitals that the the assistant collected when you came in and everything there looks good including your blood pressure you know with symptoms like that that's one of those things that i'd be concerned about\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] now on your heart exam it sounds like it's normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs rubs or gallops so that's good as i listen i'm gon na go ahead and look here in your eyes the funduscopic exam shows papilledema and that's just some of swelling behind there in the eye and this let me do a a neurological exam this will take a few minutes you get up to follow my instructions as we go through that okay on neurological exam your cranial nerves one through twelve are intact including a normal cranial reflex and just went to watch you walk across the room here\r\n[doctor] okay turn around come back and okay so on musculoskeletal exam your gait is normal\r\n[doctor] okay go ahead sorry\r\n[patient] that's okay for your first problem your headaches your symptoms are concerning for what we call idiopathic intracranial hypertension and this is a condition that that you have increased pressure in the in your head in your brain without any known cause for it now patient also presents with often present with symptoms such as yours you know headaches worsening with activity ringing in the ears changes in your vision so i'm i'm pretty confident that that's what we're having here now why we get concerned is if the pressure continues to increase this can lead to some permanent changes in your vision so i i do wan na get a a few more tests just so we can confirm that diagnosis and the first one that we just talked about is an mri i think it's really important to get that to check for any other condition that could be contributing to your symptoms now once i have that result i'm gon na be doing also doing a spinal tap which will help me evaluate the pressure in the brain and it can also help you feel better if you do have an increased pressure by taking the decreasing the amount of that pressure just by taking a a a little bit of fluid off of that and lastly i want you to be seen by a neuro-ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam now i i know that sounds like a lot of information but i think it's really important we get that accomplished do you have any questions for me\r\n[doctor] yeah that is a lot and so i i'm sure i'll have more that comes up but so let's say we do all this test and it confirms what you're saying does that mean was i referred to you because that means i will need surgery\r\n[patient] not necessarily if you have idiopathic intracranial hypertension there are number of medications that we can try to help decrease that pressure in your brain and this will also help you have less headaches when you exercise as exercise and weight loss are also an important part of the treatment\r\n[doctor] okay alright alright and i'll probably add something about so is this something i'll be doing soon is this all things i'll be doing this week\r\n[patient] yeah that's a great question here i i'm gon na go ahead and we're gon na for the mri i'll have to get a preapproval from your insurance company i will work on that my my my team in the front office will get that preapproved and then once that's done we'll call you to help schedule that mri\r\n[doctor] okay alright thank you bye\r\n[patient] bye sorry",

that i also wan na order an mri just because you said you did n't go to the hospital or anything like that i just wan na make sure that you you're not suffering from like a concussion but this is something that's commonly referred to as like whiplash right your head just like it it just wiped essentially like back and forth to so severely and and that's probably what's causing your pain i think i wan na refer you to either physical rehab or a chiropractor once we get the results of the mri just to make sure that there is n't any impingement of like the nerves or anything like that do you have any questions\r\n[patient] i heard the chiropractors will shake they work\r\n[doctor] i do understand that some people have like reservations about going to the chiropractor but you know we

you've had for a few weeks now\r\n[patient] yeah it was i was doing some work in my backyard and a lot of different projects going on and you know i was obviously sore all over the next couple of days but my my right shoulder just keeps on bothering me and it keeps it's just really sore and it just has n't been going away\r\n[doctor] okay so have you had ever had any pain in that shoulder before\r\n[patient] a little bit i you know i i hurt that same shoulder because it's my my dominant hand my right hand i hurt it playing baseball when i was younger\r\n[doctor] mm-hmm\r\n[patient] so i've always had a little bit issues but this is it's does n't feel like it's in the rotator cuff it's it's kinda more on the outside and it's kinda like it's more tender on the outside when i raise my arm up so\r\n[doctor] okay yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not\r\n[patient] yeah there is no restriction with my arm it just i definitely feel some pain on the outside of it\r\n[doctor] okay and are you having pain all the time or just or does it come and go\r\n[patient] just whenever i move it if i'm sitting still i really do n't notice anything but whenever i move it then i can definitely feel some pain\r\n[doctor] okay how about at night is it bothering you at night also\r\n[patient] a little bit because i sleep on that side so\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] of course\r\n[doctor] okay and i may miss did you say what have you been taking for pain for that\r\n[patient] i just been taking some advil and then icing as much as i can so that's about it\r\n[doctor] okay and does that seem to help or\r\n[patient] a little bit yeah a little bit i mean it's it's still like you know sore to touch but it definitely dulls it a little bit\r\n[doctor] well sounds like you have quite a few projects going on what all what all are you doing for for your yard and\r\n[patient] i well let's see i've been putting an outdoor shower in we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work i got a laundry lift\r\n[doctor] wow it sounds like a variety of projects but if you're putting down stone you're probably lifting those as well and then\r\n[patient] yeah\r\n[doctor] yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or\r\n[patient] no not really no numbness that i can think of\r\n[doctor] okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven . eight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan\r\n[patient] no that sounds good\r\n[doctor] okay alright yeah a lot of patients it's very successful with the physical therapy so i really hope that will do it and so we'll just start there okay\r\n[patient] sounds great\r\n[doctor] okay thanks\r\n[patient] thanks\r\n[doctor] did you have any other any other problems any other injuries that that went along with this or\r\n[patient] my both my my feet are actually really sore too i obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work so you know it's kinda it's really stiff and stuff and they you know my ankle joints as well my wife seems to think that i do n't drink enough water so it could be something along that lines but i do n't know they're kinda this they just they're really sore and stuff so i've been trying to put them up and kinda put ice on them keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit but\r\n[doctor] yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that\r\n[patient] okay that sounds like a plan that sounds good",

better\r\n[patient] i've taken some tylenol and ibuprofen but as soon as those wear off it it comes right back so they do n't really help\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] and i did try a little ice i

that and out there playing tennis kinda back back to the back to the old days for you right did do i recall that were n't you a big tennis player back in the day like state champ in high school or something\r\n[patient] yeah yeah that was a hundred years ago i ca n't i i try to play like that and i ca n't i ca n't do that anymore but yeah a good memory that's a that's a good memory\r\n[doctor] now\r\n[patient] kind of a tennis guy too right did you see the the australia open\r\n[doctor] i did i did yeah that was that was crazy that was a great tournament what a what a finish unbelievable\r\n[patient] yeah hey did you see the masters i know you're a golfer\r\n[doctor] yeah yeah yeah i do n't get out as often as i as as i like to but but the masters yeah that was that was amazing that was lot of fun to lot of fun did you catch it too\r\n[patient] i did\r\n[doctor] yeah\r\n[patient] yeah\r\n[doctor] yeah\r\n[patient] but that's it was i i could n't believe tiger went out there of course he did\r\n[doctor] right\r\n[patient] it was cool to see nothing\r\n[doctor] yep yep agreed agreed and so well listen we'll we'll hopefully get you feeling better here and get you back out on the court and out on the course and we'll talk about that but let's let me ask you about your diabetes a little bit a little bit here so how have your blood sugars been running mark have they been what in the low one hundreds two hundreds where are they\r\n[patient] they are like one fifty one sixty you know we just had easter and my kids got a whole bunch of candies so i keep eating that\r\n[doctor] hmmm okay yeah yeah understood so those cadboy eggs they'll get you every time too right\r\n[patient] yes\r\n[doctor] boy my gosh yeah those are the best so those are those are deadly do n't tell my cardiologist so okay so listen you know i see that we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams once a day no actually last visit we increased it so i've got you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day correct you're still taking that\r\n[patient] yes twice a day\r\n[doctor] okay and but your blood sugars are a bit off you know maybe those the cadberry eggs so how about your asthma how has that been doing you know have you had any asthma attacks you're still taking flovent twice a day and the albuterol as needed\r\n[patient] yeah knock on wood i my asthma is pretty much under control\r\n[doctor] okay excellent excellent alright and i recall you know just kinda review a few things i i think you've got an allergy to penicillin is that correct\r\n[patient] that's correct yes\r\n[doctor] okay and then you you know your surgical history you had your your gallbladder out what about ten years ago i think by doctor nelson correct\r\n[patient] yes that's right\r\n[doctor] okay and then let's go ahead and examine you alright so mark your exam is pretty much you know for the most part normal with a few exceptions on your heart exam you still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur and that's unchanged from prior exam we're watching that and so that just means i hear some some heart sounds as your heart is beating there i'm not too concerned about it as as that's not changed otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and your physical exam otherwise on your musculoskeletal exam on your right elbow you do have moderate lateral epicondylar tenderness of the right elbow and how about when i move this when i move your elbow like this does that hurt you\r\n[patient] kills\r\n[doctor] okay sorry about that so you've got moderate pain with passive range of motion of the right elbow there is no palpable joint effusion and now what if i press against your wrist like so does that hurt you\r\n[patient] yeah it hurts a little bit\r\n[doctor] okay alright sorry so that's you have mild pain with resisted extension of the right wrist as well okay otherwise normal unremarkable exam and let's talk about your results now so your right elbow x-ray today shows no acute fracture or other bony abnormality so that's good there's no malalignment or sign of joint effusion and otherwise it's a normal right elbow x-ray so that's reassuring okay and hey you know i meant to ask you you know and do you have any history of fever recently you know along with the elbow pain you had noticed a fever\r\n[patient] no i do n't think so\r\n[doctor] okay great excellent alright so tell you what let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan here so for your first problem my assessment is is that you have acute lateral epicondylitis of your right elbow and this is also known as tennis elbow go figure right so this is due to overuse likely the increase in your your tennis activity which normally would be good but maybe we're overdoing it a little bit so i have a few recommendations i'd like you to rest your right arm as much as you can i want you to stop tennis for the next four to six weeks and please avoid repetitive stress in that right arm as well i want you to ice that right elbow for twenty minutes at least three times per day and this should reduce the pain and inflammation and then i'm also going to give you a brace for your right forearm and my nurse will give this to you before you leave that should help with the discomfort okay in that right elbow i will also write you a prescription for ultram and this should help with the pain i'll write you a prescription ultram fifty milligrams once per day that should help with your elbow pain so then i wan na see you in follow-up in four weeks and so we'll reevaluate your elbow at that time and if you we'll consider some additional imaging if needed possibly a physical therapy referral depending on how you're doing mkay now for your second problem of diabetes type two my assessment is is that your blood sugar is a little bit out of control mkay so we need to make some adjustments i'm going to increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice per day and i want you to check your blood sugar twice daily for the next two weeks and then let me know how your blood sugar is running and we can make some additional adjustments if needed but i will increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice a day now i'm going to also order a hemoglobin a1c level and and a cbc blood test today and and so we'll check those results the hemoglobin a1c and the cbc and then i'm going to also check a chem-12 blood test as well and now for your third problem of the mild acute intermittent asthma you my assessment is that it really remains under good control so let's keep you on that flovent and the albuterol no changes there and you can use those as tolerated it does look like you need a refill on your albuterol so i'm gon na write you a prescription for a refill of the albuterol and you can pick that up at your pharmacy as well so how does that all sound any questions for me\r\n[patient] it sounds pretty good i ca n't believe it's just tennis elbow feel like a looser coming in here but it's okay i get it\r\n[doctor] yeah yeah well\r\n[patient] i'm not i'm not young anymore\r\n[doctor] yeah well let's let's keep you active but take a break for a bit and let's ease back into it okay so it's great to see you and i'll see you back in four weeks let me know if you have other problems in the meantime\r\n[patient] okay",

so first thing what's going on with your kidneys you as what how long ago have you been feeling pain and and how's all that\r\n[patient] pain's been up and down i went to the emergency room last week but now i think i'm doing a little bit better\r\n[doctor] okay so the case of kidney stones so have you had you said you've had them in the past and how often would you say\r\n[patient] i do n't know i this is probably like my seventh or eighth kidney stone\r\n[doctor] seven or eight kidney stones so do you think you passed it yet or is it still in the\r\n[patient] i think this one passed yeah\r\n[doctor] this one passed how long would you say it took to\r\n[patient] well i went last week and then i think it passed about three days ago\r\n[doctor] okay so are you still noticing any blood in your urine\r\n[patient] no no more blood\r\n[doctor] alright are you still having pain\r\n[patient] nope\r\n[doctor] yeah\r\n[patient] the pain's gone\r\n[doctor] okay that that's that's that's really good did they do anything for you at the hospital giving you any medications\r\n[patient] they gave me some pain medicine\r\n[doctor] okay do you remember what it was\r\n[patient] i think it was percocet\r\n[doctor] okay well that's good i'm very glad to see that you were able to pass that stone have you seen a urologist before about this\r\n[patient] i have n't seen one in a while but yes i saw someone maybe a year ago\r\n[doctor] okay so yeah i know you keep having these recurrent kidney stones so i definitely think we can get you a referral to urology just to check up on that and also wan na do some labs as well\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] so i also see you're here for you have a past medical history of of hypertension and when you came in today your blood pressure was a little bit high it was a one fifty over ninety i'm reading here in your chart you're on two point five of norvasc\r\n[patient] hmmm\r\n[doctor] now have you been taking that regularly\r\n[patient] i have but at home my blood pressure is always great\r\n[doctor] okay maybe you have a little white coat syndrome some of my patients do have it i have it myself and i'm a provider so i definitely understand yeah i know we we talked about last time you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking those about two to three times a week so what have those readings been i'm usually like one thirty to one forty over sixty to seventy\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] that's that's that's not too bad i think when you first came in you were around like one eighty so it seems to be that that norvasc is is working for you how about your diet i know you were having a little issue eating some fast food and and cakes and cookies and have you been able to get that under control\r\n[patient] yeah it's hard to give up the fast food altogether because it's a lot of on the go you know\r\n[doctor] okay so do you think you would be able to get that under control by yourself or would you do you think you would need help with that maybe a dietitian be able to help you out\r\n[patient] yeah i do n't know i do n't know if i can make another appointment i just add to the extra\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] less time to make food so\r\n[doctor] yeah yeah definitely understand\r\n[patient] mm-hmm\r\n[doctor] alright yeah so i mean that's one thing we just got ta work one is your diet we try to keep you at least just twenty three hundred milligrams or less of sodium per day i know that's hard for a lot of salads and stuff i know it's hard for lot of people especially with all like the the prepackage foods we have around today so that's definitely something we we should work on\r\n[patient] mm-hmm\r\n[doctor] so let's also look here you have a history of diabetes and so you're on that five hundred milligrams of metformin daily now have you been taking that as well\r\n[patient] yeah i take my metformin\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] yeah\r\n[doctor] so what have your blood sugars been running daily\r\n[patient] well i do n't check it very often\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] but i think they've been pretty good\r\n[doctor] okay so i'm looking here i think last after your last visit you got a1c now was six . seven so it's a little bit high it's gone down a little bit since you were first diagnosed with the type two diabetes a year ago so i'm glad we're making progress with that as well alright so i'm just gon na do a quick physical exam on you before i do just wan na make sure are you having any chest pain today\r\n[patient] no\r\n[doctor] alright any any belly pain\r\n[patient] no\r\n[doctor] alright so i'm gon na listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles listen to your heart so on your heart exam i do hear that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and we already knew about that previously so it has n't gotten any worse so that's good so i'm gon na just press here in your abdomen because that you did have those kidney stones does that hurt\r\n[patient] no\r\n[doctor] alright i'm gon na press here on your back\r\n[patient] no pain\r\n[doctor] okay so on your abdomen exam of your abdomen i'm showing no tenderness to palpation of the abdomen or tenderness of the the cva either on the right side so that that's good i think that's pretty much cleared up so let's we'll talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you and so my assessment you you did have the those kidney stones but i i think they are passed this time but i do want to get a couple of labs so we'll get a urinalysis\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] alright we'll get a urine culture just to make sure everything is is cleared up i also want to give you a referral to referral referral to urology\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] because you do keep having these all the time and so maybe there's something else going wrong and so they can help get that under control\r\n[patient] can i see doctor harris\r\n[doctor] of course yeah we can we can get you that road to doctor harris and\r\n[patient] he's not like\r\n[doctor] he's great he's he's he he he's great i've heard he does really good work so that'll be good so for the hypertension you seem to be doing well on the two . five of norvasc so we are not gon na make any changes to that do you need any refills right now\r\n[patient] no usually the pharmacy just sends them through when i call\r\n[doctor] okay great so we we wo n't we gave you refills with that i do wan na give you a consult to nutrition\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] just to help you with that diet\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] because i think that's a major factor of us eventually getting you off of all medications\r\n[patient] hmmm\r\n[doctor] and then for your diabetes i'm just keep you on that on that five hundred of metformin okay i think you're doing well with that as well also but i do want you to start taking your blood sugars if you can take them before every meal\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] just to gauge where you are so you can tell how much food you should actually be be eating\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] alright\r\n[patient] i can try that\r\n[doctor] so how does that that sound\r\n[patient] that sounds like a plan when should i come back and see you\r\n[doctor] so you can you can come back in three months and we'll check up again i forgot you did tell me last time that you were having some issues with insomnia\r\n[patient] hmmm\r\n[doctor] how is that going for you is it still happening\r\n[patient] i mean sometimes i stay awake just kinda worrying about things but but i've tried some meditation apps and that helps\r\n[doctor] okay alright and i know we talked a little bit before about practicing proper sleep hygiene you know just making sure that all of your electronics are off you know dark room\r\n[patient] yeah\r\n[doctor] cool room have you been doing that\r\n[patient] well i do like to sleep with the tv on and my phone is right by my bed because i never know if someone's gon na call me you know\r\n[doctor] yeah i i know i'm like apple i do n't

yeah\r\n[doctor] okay have you tried taking melatonin to sleep\r\n[patient] i used it a couple times but but it did n't seem to help that much\r\n[doctor] okay how about i do n't think i've prescribed you anything yet do you think you would need anything\r\n[patient] hmmm i do n't really wan na take any sleeping pills\r\n[doctor] okay that's understandable alright so for the last issue for the

to sleep at night and and feel pretty rested\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] alright\r\n[patient] mm-hmm\r\n[doctor] so do you have anything any other questions for me\r\n[patient] no that's

i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing\r\n[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms\r\n[patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since\r\n[doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems\r\n[patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department\r\n[doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now\r\n[patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work\r\n[doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or\r\n[patient] yes yes that's the name of it\r\n[doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that\r\n[patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well\r\n[doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help\r\n[patient] it does\r\n[doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs\r\n[patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs\r\n[doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep\r\n[patient] yeah for the most part\r\n[doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er\r\n[patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then\r\n[doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those\r\n[patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone\r\n[doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing\r\n[patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days\r\n[doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay\r\n[patient] yeah\r\n[doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation\r\n[patient] probably about a month ago\r\n[doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that\r\n[patient] no not really\r\n[doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center\r\n[patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again\r\n[doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis\r\n[patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana\r\n[doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all\r\n[patient] hmmm hmmm\r\n[doctor] okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that\r\n[patient] sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] so i do n't try to go there often\r\n[doctor] okay thank you for sharing that with me so if it's okay with you i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] now i reviewed your vitals for today and your your blood pressure is good it's one twenty eight over eighty two your respiratory rate is sixteen and your oxygen saturation is ninety nine percent on room air which is a good thing i'm gon na take a listen to your heart here your heart is regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any ectopic beats or and i do n't hear anything like rubs murmurs or gallops which is good so i'm gon na go take and listen to your lungs here on your lung exam i do appreciate some diminished lung sounds throughout with the occasional slight expiratory wheeze and that's bilaterally so i hear that on both sides i'm gon na go do a quick neck exam here neck is supple trachea is midline i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy taking a listen here i do n't appreciate any carotid bruit now i'm also gon na take a look at your hands here i note strong bilateral pulses i do n't appreciate any clubbing on any of your fingertips which is which is important and i also note brisk capillary refill i'm gon na go ahead and review the results of your pulmonary function test that i had you do when you came into the office today and reviewing those results i do see that they are consistent with somebody who would be diagnosed with asthma so lem me go ahead and tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so now for your first problem of asthma your symptoms are consistent with moderate to intermediate or i'm sorry moderate moderate intermittent asthma and it's gon na be really important for us to be consistent with your inhaled inhaled steroid inhaler so i'm gon na need you to take that as prescribed and that's really gon na help cut down on those daily symptoms and needing to use that rescue inhaler that albuterol inhaler as frequently so the more you take and more consistently you take your inhaled steroid inhaler the less you will use your albuterol now it's not a fast acting inhaler like your albuterol but what is important is as going to be what helps you long term now if you do have an acute exacerbation so if you're having an acute issue with your breathing i do want you to continue to use your albuterol inhaler one to two puffs and then i want you to wait and see how your breathing is before you would take an additional one to two puffs we hope you have less of those acute exacerbations as you continue to use your inhaled steroid i'm also going to put together an asthma action plan for you and that's gon na help us look at your symptoms see where your your pain points can be you know like those being having issues with with cats or dust that type of thing and we'll work on how to handle those symptoms through that asthma action plan so do you have any questions comments or concerns otherwise i will see you in thirty days\r\n[patient] alright thank you\r\n[doctor] you're welcome\r\n[doctor] so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan for your first problem of asthma your symptoms are consistent with moderate intermittent asthma i'm gon na start you on flovent one hundred ten micrograms one puff twice per day that's gon na be important for you to be consistent with your inhaled steroid inhaler this is gon na help prevent those daily symptoms and from needing for you to use your albuterol inhaler or that rescue inhaler less frequently you can continue using your ventolin inhaler and that would be two puffs every four to six hours p.r.n . i'm also gon na put together an asthma action plan for you so we know what to do based on your symptoms i'd like to see you again in a month or sooner if you have any worsening symptoms does that sound okay\r\n[patient] it does thank you\r\n[doctor] you're welcome i'll see you in a month\r\n[patient]

now\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] and i have tried so many things and just nothing seems to work\r\n[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that now do you remember what caused the pain initially\r\n[patient] you know i never fell or was in an accident but i do remember it all happened like i started having back pain after i was moving furniture one weekend\r\n[doctor] okay and now can you describe the pain for me\r\n[patient] yeah it feels like a sharp stabbing pain in my back and it does go down even down to my right leg sometimes all the way down to my toe it feels like my big toe\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] and i also feel like i just ca n't get comfortable which is worse when i sit down okay yeah\r\n[doctor] okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain\r\n[patient] yeah i do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] let me separate these\r\n[doctor] and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area\r\n[patient] no nothing like that\r\n[doctor] okay now do you have any weakness\r\n[patient] i would n't say i have any weakness no\r\n[doctor] okay do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels\r\n[patient] no\r\n[doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you you have some tried tried some things in the past so tell me what were they\r\n[patient] so i've tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me but that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery\r\n[doctor] okay sure so tell me what is your day like\r\n[patient] my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years\r\n[doctor] okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf\r\n[patient] yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back\r\n[doctor] yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right\r\n[patient] exactly\r\n[doctor] well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions\r\n[patient] no i ca n't recall any family members\r\n[doctor] okay alright and do you smoke\r\n[patient] not now i i quit about twenty years ago\r\n[doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit\r\n[patient] okay that's painful\r\n[doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that\r\n[patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time\r\n[doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year\r\n[patient] okay okay\r\n[doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] alright sounds good\r\n[doctor] alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection\r\n[patient] alright thank you\r\n[doctor] alright thank you\r\n[patient] bye",

noticing\r\n[patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it\r\n[doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling

had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press\r\n[patient] yeah that's sore\r\n[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt\r\n[patient] yeah do n't do that anymore\r\n[doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that\r\n[patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan\r\n[doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions\r\n[patient] i think so sounds like a good plan to me\r\n[doctor] okay sounds good alright so i'll see you later we'll get those ordered and i'll be in touch okay take care bye\r\n[patient] thank you",

but then they did that chest x-ray to make sure i did n't have pneumonia and they found this lung nodule i went for a cat scan that confirmed it and they referred me here to you i'm really nervous document\r\n[doctor] okay well first of all i'm i'm sorry that you're nervous and what we're gon na do is we're gon na partner together okay and i'm gon na be right by your side the whole time to hopefully make you a little less nervous and and recognize the fact that we're you're gon na have a big support team around you okay\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] so let's talk a little bit about how long you've had that cough before you went to see your doctor\r\n[patient] i you know off and on i've had it for about three months i first noticed it when i was loading some pay i have horses and i i bought you know four hundred bills a day and when i spent a day loading it and then it's i just started coughing a lot more i think around that time and after that i i i just got a cold so that's what sent me to my pcp now i i i do exercise i i do a lot of biking and i typically do n't get sick and my cough has gone away\r\n[doctor] okay that's good to hear you mentioned exercise and biking i love to bike myself i've got a track seventy one hundred hybrid have you been on the the new trails they opened it was the old the old rail the old rail road right away they've opened that up it's like sixty miles of trails\r\n[patient] i love that that road i just i i do n't like riding on the road so i prefer to do those rails the trails type\r\n[doctor] yeah\r\n[patient] and it's just so phenomenal i do that a lot\r\n[doctor] yeah i love riding over there way we will we will get you all fixed up we will have to go for a bike ride\r\n[patient] absolutely i'd love it\r\n[doctor] that'd be great so i see here on your medical history that you also have a history of rheumatoid arthritis is that under control at this time and and and what do you do to to take care of your ra\r\n[patient] yeah it's it's it's fair you know arthritis never really goes away but i take methotrexate\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] i think it's seven and a half milligrams every week and as long as i'm keeping active my joints feel okay and if i do have any problems it's it's mostly with my hands but i have n't had any recent flares so i'm okay right now\r\n[doctor] okay that's good i also see here that you marked down that you were a previous smoker and and when when did you when did you stop smoking\r\n[patient] i stopped smoking probably about seven years ago\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] and i was young and should have stopped the way before that my kids were on me all the time but you know i i got a new start and finally was able to stop and i felt better after stopping\r\n[doctor] okay that's good and i'm glad to hear that you were able to to to stop and and stay tobacco free that that's great to hear do you have any pain or any shortness of breath or anything like that\r\n[patient] no not at all\r\n[doctor] okay and i would like to talk about your familial history here for just a second do you have any family history of lung cancer or any other type of malignancies\r\n[patient] no lung cancer my mom did have breast cancer but she is doing well now\r\n[doctor] okay alright and then things like lung infections or pneumonia do you have any previous history of that\r\n[patient] no no not not anything that i'm aware of\r\n[doctor] okay if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure of one twenty four over seventy six heart rate of seventy respiration rate of sixteen o2 sat on room air of ninety eight percent and you are afebrile so you do n't have a fever today i'm gon na take a quick listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear and equal bilateral when i listen to them or when i auscultate your lungs now listening to your heart regular rate and rhythm no clicks rubs or murmurs and i do n't appreciate any extra beats doing a quick extremity exam your skin is pink warm and dry i do n't appreciate any edema to your lower extremities it looks like you do have a little bit of swelling to to your knuckles there on your third digit on each hand which can be normal for somebody who has ra however pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk so a quick review of your results now you had a chest ct before you came in to see me and the results of that chest ct do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now it appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present which is good now for my assessment and plan for you so you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule i'm going to order some pft which is pulmonary function test i just wan na get a check and and a baseline for your lung function i'm also going to schedule a pet ct this is gon na help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest i'm gon na go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung you're gon na be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're gon na be admitted and you will have a chest tube in until the following day and i'm gon na go ahead and take that out then at bedside most likely you're gon na be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day it could be a benign nodule but because your smoking history i really do think it's gon na be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis i want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been previously outlined for you now do you have any questions comments or concerns before before we get the paperwork signed to start the the treatment process\r\n[patient] no i do n't think so i think i'll be okay i'm scared\r\n[doctor] i i know you're scared but we'll be right here with you the whole way\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] alright we'll get some paperwork and i'll see you again in a few minutes\r\n[patient] okay thank you",

He will have a chest tube in until the following day when I remove it at his bedside. All questions were answered.\r\n- Medical Treatment: Pulmonary function test ordered today to obtain patient's baseline.

what's going on with your swallowing problem\r\n[patient] well it's just been something that i have noticed over the last you know four to five weeks it seems like something is always stuck in my throat and you know just i kinda go about my day and it kinda bothers me you know a little bit sometimes a little painful and when i try to eat it just seems like i have to i do n't know when it's something solid i kinda have to wash it down on occasion i i've never really fully choked but i have to admit that i've thought about potentially choking\r\n[doctor] okay and is it seem to be stuck in your throat or does it seem to go in your lungs area or are you coughing with this at all or just mostly when you're swallowing\r\n[patient] no coughing just kinda when i swallow it's all okay with liquids but when i kinda swallow you know like a bite of a sandwich sometimes it just feels like like i just need a little help pushing it down\r\n[doctor] okay and is it more kind of a like heart like steaks or heart like larger solid like things that are that you have to chew more or is it even soft stuff like you know to eat yogurt and stuff like that\r\n[patient] i'm not a hundred percent sure but i think it's probably more with solids\r\n[doctor] okay how about have you noticed anything different with when you're swallowing cold or or or hot liquids is there is there a temperature change any modification to that\r\n[patient] it's really just about solids\r\n[doctor] okay alright so have you noticed any blood in any place or blood in your stools or are you vomiting anything up at all\r\n[patient] no\r\n[doctor] okay that so no vomiting blood no coughing up blood or anything like that any weight loss or changes in your weight at all\r\n[patient] not that i want\r\n[doctor] okay yeah i mean i think we all like to lose a little bit of weight but yeah it's a it says it's a struggle so no no chest pain or shortness of breath with this\r\n[patient] no\r\n[doctor] okay so i i'm gon na you know we'll talk about that in a second i'll look at your throat as well and see what we need to do but it sounds like we may have to send you to a specialist to take a look at that and see if there is something causing this how about how are you doing with your diabetes by the way since i have n't seen you in a while i know we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time was seven . four we talked about improving your diet and exercise how are things going\r\n[patient] i think they're going great i mean i'm taking my meds i'm sticking to them and i feel pretty good otherwise\r\n[doctor] okay are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or are you checking those at all\r\n[patient] yeah i do i mean once in a while i i'm in a hurry and i skip it but i have to say i probably do so about eighty percent of the time\r\n[doctor] and how are the numbers looking\r\n[patient] they're looking you know okay they are all within you know the range that we are targeting\r\n[doctor] okay alright and any any no nausea vomiting or diarrhea or any other side effects from the metformin or anything like that\r\n[patient] no\r\n[doctor] okay good so i think we should probably repeat your hemoglobin a1c it sounds like you've you know you've improved your diet and it sounds like you've you're following the regimen so maybe the numbers will be better this time and we do n't have to change your medication so that will be awesome how are you doing with your blood pressure i know we have you on norvasc we asked that you check it like you know once a week or more than that if you have time blood pressure looks good today in the office it's about one fifty i'm sorry one twenty over fifty right now so no nothing here in the office how are things at home\r\n[patient] i get there now every once in a while you know the lower numbers a little bit you know higher but it's not you know usually it's either close or or on on range\r\n[doctor] okay alright good so let me examine you now so tyler i'm examining you now i'm gon na just verbalize some of my findings your neck is fine i do n't see any swelling in your neck your thyroid feels normal i do n't feel any masses in your neck there's no lymph nodes i'm looking at your throat and that looks okay there is no masses or any swelling that i can see there is no redness yeah there is no carotid bruit your lung exam is clear your heart exam is normal no murmurs on your belly exam you have some epigastric tenderness right here in the right here where i'm pressing but i do n't feel any masses or any significant swelling back there no normal back exam your extremity exam looks normal your neurological exam's fine so for this difficulty swallowing i'm concerned that you may have a narrowing in your throat that's causing this and sometimes it can be from a stricture where some narrowing of the esophagus and sometimes i need to go in and dilate that so i'm gon na go ahead and send you give you a referral for gastroenterology and have them do a scope and take a look down there i'm gon na recommend we put you on some prilosec sometimes also reflux medicine can if you have reflux sometimes that can also exacerbate this sometimes so i'm gon na put you on some prilosec twenty milligrams once a day again i'm gon na recommend that you chew your foods frequently and make sure you have a you know especially if you're eating something hard like steak or meat chew them really well so they do n't get tend to get stuck some people have sometimes things get stuck and they do n't go down and if that happens as an emergency you do have to go to the emergency department but seems like you know things are going down they just seem to sometimes slow down or get stuck temporarily so why do n't i get you a referral for gi we will start you on the prilosec and then we will have you you know if you you know if you have any other symptoms or worsenings give my office a call we will get you in or get you referred to the er if needed any questions about that\r\n[patient] no that sounds great\r\n[doctor] okay and for the diabetes i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c i'm gon na order some more blood work today we'll check a kidney function and i notice that you have not had an eye referral so i'm gon na also give you an eye referral to ophthalmology to check your eyes for your diabetic for your for any retinopathy continue the metformin i'll have you come back in about a month and that way we'll have the results back for the blood test if we need to make any adjustments we can but i i wan na see you back in about a month and i think that's it for that any questions about that\r\n[patient] no\r\n[doctor] okay and the high blood pressure i think you're doing great continue with the norvasc if you have any issues certainly call me but otherwise there is really nothing else to add for that did we forget anything or do you need refills for anything\r\n[patient] you know i think i'm low on the norvasc so if you could send something to my pharmacy that would be great\r\n[doctor] okay sure i'll get you a refill for norvasc

up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys\r\n[doctor] good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad\r\n[patient] yeah yes\r\n[doctor] okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too\r\n[patient] yeah a little bit\r\n[doctor] okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all\r\n[patient] yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid\r\n[doctor] sure so it does n't quite feel stable\r\n[patient] yeah\r\n[doctor] okay okay i gotcha so i know you had an x-ray as you came in today and so i'm just looking at this x-ray here i'll show you on the screen right here i can turn my monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches\r\n[patient] how long it's a little bit because i'm also i i forgot to say i'm also i did volunteer to coach\r\n[doctor] great\r\n[patient] starting in april so\r\n[doctor] alright well\r\n[patient] how long\r\n[doctor] yeah you you're probably gon na be out for about three months but continue the coaching go ahead and and let's get you back out there we'll get you some crutches and and hopefully you can kinda you know get back on the court start coaching and then within that three months we'll we'll get you back out doing some exercise again\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] alright in the meantime i'm gon na prescribe some medication for now let's try meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly\r\n[patient] yeah i i work from home so that that should n't be a problem it's just everything else i do n't know who is gon na walk my dogs and and do all this stuff that's rest of my family refuses to walk my dog so we'll figure it out\r\n[doctor] yeah i i'm a dog walker as well so alright sorry for the bad news but let's get you healed up so that we can get you back out doing everything you need to do\r\n[patient] alright thank you doctor\r\n[doctor] alright thanks",

mister edwards i'm doctor\r\n[doctor] tell me what's been going on yeah so i've got this stabbing shooting pain i've had for a while you know and it it especially right here in my right face right in that cheek bone area it's sometimes it gets super hot i've had it for i think a couple of months now and i went to my family doctor and they said i should come see you\r\n[patient] okay great i would like to ask you a little bit more about that\r\n[doctor] had in your face do you remember how long that you had it probably for about two or three months just just came on slowly i started noticing it but now it's i have episodes where just shooting stabbing kind of a pain in my right cheek bone right face area\r\n[patient] mm-hmm do you have any sensory loss meaning like numbness or tingling in that part of your face\r\n[doctor] not that i've noticed no okay do you have any symptoms like this anywhere else on your face including the other side of your face\r\n[patient] no it's just on the right side mostly not on the left side just on the right side of my face\r\n[doctor] have you noticed any weakness on that side of the face like when you smile or while you're doing other things any weakness there not really i mean i've i've i've tried to you know when i smile my smile seems equal on both sides my eyes i do n't have any weakness there my vision seems to be unchanged but just this stabbing severe pain it's just like excruciating pain that i get sometimes does it happen on its own or there are certain things that trigger it\r\n[patient] sometimes if i'm if certain temperatures seem to trigger it sometimes or if it's super where it's cold i get a trigger sometimes\r\n[doctor] sometimes certain kind of sensory outside of the wind sometimes that seems to trigger it but that's about it\r\n[patient] okay and anything that you've done to to that helps for a little bit when you\r\n[doctor] pain excess\r\n[patient] you know i've tried ibuprofen and motrin that had really has n't helped it just comes on suddenly and then it's kinda stabbing excruciating pain i've tried rubbing some you know some tiger balm on it that did n't work\r\n[doctor] but that's you know so i i went to my family doctor and he said you know i really need to see a neurosurgeon\r\n[patient] got it how long do these episodes last these pain\r\n[doctor] you know it can last for anywhere from a few minutes to sometimes about an hour but generally generally a few minutes\r\n[patient] any history of something like multiple sclerosis or any brain tumors that you know\r\n[doctor] no nothing like that alright any other kinda headache symptoms that have anything like you had migraines or anything related to the headaches i mean i get occasional headaches but not really i do n't have a history of migraines but i occasionally get headaches like everybody else i take some tylenol that usually goes away but this is different\r\n[patient] how severe is the pain on a scale of one to ten\r\n[doctor] when it comes on it's like a ten it's like somebody is stabbing you with an ice pick and but usually you know after a few minutes usually it goes away but sometimes it can last up to an hour great so mister i would like to do a physical exam if that's okay with you\r\n[patient] sure\r\n[doctor] i would like you to follow my finger here and i see that you're following my finger in in both directions can you show me your teeth\r\n[patient] that looks nice and symmetric i'm gon na rub my fingers next to your ear can you hear that\r\n[doctor] yep\r\n[patient] you can hear it on the other side as well\r\n[doctor] yep\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] i'm gon na take this cotton tape and run it along the side of your face can you feel that okay\r\n[patient] yeah it's a little bit numb on my right side not so much on my left side\r\n[doctor] okay alright i'm gon na use this little needle here and i'm gon na poke here and i wan na see if you feel like it's being sharp or dull on that part of your face does that feel different or normal\r\n[patient] it feels a little bit dull on my left on my right side my left side it feels sharp\r\n[doctor] alright good well i had a chance to look at your mri\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] and i looked at your mri and it appears to have small blood vessel that is abutting and perhaps even pinching the trigeminal nerve the trigeminal nerve is nerve that comes from the brainstem that goes out to the face and provides the sensory inflammation from the face and you may have a condition called trigeminal neuralgia\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] where the nerve compression causes this kind of shooting electrical pain in the face how do we treat it\r\n[patient] well the first line would be to try some medications usually we start with medications that are called gabapentin\r\n[doctor] or tegretol these are medications that really help reduce the excitability of the nerve\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] most people can get the pain control with that but there are some people where the medications are n't gon na be enough and in that situation we would consider surgery i would n't i would n't recommend that now we usually try the medications first\r\n[patient] for considering a surgery to decompress the nerve the root cause of the problem is the compression of the blood vessel against the nerve\r\n[doctor] okay so we should be tried which one would you recommend the tegretol or yeah i think we could start with the tegretol to start with i just want to make sure that you understand some of the potential side effects that you can have with this\r\n[patient] sure\r\n[doctor] it's always a little bit of trial and error to figure out what the right dosing that would work for you but some common side effects can include you know memory loss tingling imbalance some people can actually have like dermatologic\r\n[patient] skin reaction to this medication and particularly people who have eustachian descent so that we may do some genetic testing just to make sure that it will be safe for you\r\n[doctor] okay sounds good let's do it\r\n[patient] okay so i will prescribe that for you and then we will see how that goes and if your pain continues we can talk about different surgical options to treat the pain\r\n[doctor] yeah i think i would like to try the tegretol first and if that does n't work then i can come back and so once should i come back and just to kinda check back with you and see if you know if it's had enough time for a fact or not\r\n[patient] i think one month would be a great time to follow up\r\n[doctor] okay sounds good so if you want to send that prescription over to my pharmacy that would be fine and then why do n't i come back in about a month and we'll go from there\r\n[patient] great i'll see you then\r\n[doctor] alright",

make sure that i'm giving you the best advise possible and in order to do that i need the most information that you can provide me makes sense\r\n[patient] yes\r\n[doctor] alright so we're gon na say hope maybe that you had a car crash and we can verify this in february of this year and you've been experiencing some neck pain since then right\r\n[patient] yes\r\n[doctor] okay alright on a scale of one to ten what ten is your arm is being cut off by a chainsaw severe how bad is your pain\r\n[patient] twelve\r\n[doctor] okay terrible pain now i know you mentioned you had previous car crashes and

oh\r\n[patient] i have n't gotten a prescription for several weeks\r\n[doctor] okay alright and so we will be able to check on that when you take your medication so before you take your medication rather like are you able to move like are you experiencing any stiffness\r\n[patient] yes but it hurts\r\n[doctor] okay it hurts what kind of pain is it sharp is it dull is it throbbing\r\n[patient] it's the sharp incapacitating pain i ca n't work\r\n[doctor] wow okay are you having any headaches\r\n[patient] of course\r\n[doctor] any dizziness\r\n[patient] just sometimes\r\n[doctor] any visual disturbances is it hard to like are you\r\n[patient] not recently no\r\n[doctor] okay alright any numbness\r\n[patient] yes\r\n[doctor] where\r\n[patient] my left arm and my right leg\r\n[doctor] okay any spasms\r\n[patient] of course\r\n[doctor] okay where\r\n[patient] my body hurts i told you my neck hurts\r\n[doctor] okay so i no i'm absolutely i wan na make sure that we are gon na give you the medication that works like the best for you so i'm sorry if these questions seem like frustrating i would just wan na make sure that i understand what the problem is so\r\n[patient] i saw pamela and doctor collins's office she's much nicer than you know\r\n[doctor] i mean okay so you know what like maybe maybe pamela would be better like we could maybe talk talk about a referral if that would make you more comfortable\r\n[patient] my lawyer told me to come here\r\n[doctor] then you're stuck with me okay i'm so sorry but here it's we're gon na try and make it as good as possible alright so last thing i do wan na do my physical exam alright and i need you to let me know as as much as you as much as you can verbalize right so when i push here in the middle of your neck on top of the bone does it hurt\r\n[patient] yes yes\r\n[doctor] okay alright sorry what about on the side does that hurt\r\n[patient] yes\r\n[doctor] okay so pain on palpation both on the bony process and on the muscle can you move your neck from side to side can you move your neck can you swive it side to side no no alright so i'm i'm seeing i'm seeing some range of movement moderate range of movement that's fine okay i so when can you bend your neck forward that that's your whole body just just the neck are you capable of bending up\r\n[patient] really hurts it really hurts\r\n[doctor] okay it really hurts to bend forward and backwards okay alright so i'm just gon na make a little note here i do n't i do n't see any bruising i'm not noticing any swelling there is i i do n't see any laceration what\r\n[patient] just sometimes it bruises\r\n[doctor] okay sometimes alright that's fine i i just i'm not seeing one here today so that's okay alright so with that being said i do wan na ask have you been experiencing any fatigue are you tired\r\n[patient] well since the accident yes\r\n[doctor] okay alright just making sure okay so this is what this is my assessment and plan this is what we are gon na do i want to be able to like we had you do an x-ray before you came in here and looking at it i'm not noticing any fracture that's a really good sign considering how many car accidents we've been in lately\r\n[patient] it hurts it hurts\r\n[doctor] absolutely no i we're gon na address the pain so for my first so looking at your imaging results though i'm not seeing a fracture that's a great sign so for your first diagnosis i'm gon na say that you have what is called a neck sprain that\r\n[patient] thinking are are you saying i'm thinking\r\n[doctor] no not by any means i am saying\r\n[patient] pain i have a lot of pain\r\n[doctor] yes and your pain can be explained by multiple things but thankfully it's not a broken neck is that okay\r\n[patient] yes\r\n[doctor] alright so what we are gon na do when we are gon na like try and treat this as conservatively as possible\r\n[patient] said it might be broken\r\n[doctor] what\r\n[patient] pamela said it might be broken\r\n[doctor] if pamela said it's broken then you know what this is what we're gon na do we're gon na order something called a ct that's gon na give us even nope you know what let's upgrade to an mri it's gon na give us the most thorough image of everything that's going on the heart and the soft tissues is that gon na is that so that way we can really get a good image of what's happening inside right\r\n[patient] okay because what the lawyer said i needed was an mri\r\n[doctor] not a problem we're we're gon na make your lawyer happy next step we are going to try working like from the outside in so i do need you to work on getting like you're you're saying you've seen some bruising and some swelling yourself so i want you to put ice on that whenever you're experiencing that in the moment when you wake up i want you to do your best to just like i'm gon na give you some exercises on the sheet and i want you to roll through these exercises every morning right to just get some like movement and like free frenosive movement back into your neck i also wan na put you on a couple medications now i know that you said you were on fentanyl before that's a bit extreme and i i want i i i wan na like monitor this a little more conservatively so what we're gon na start with is something called robaxin\r\n[patient] hurts a lot if i do n't get more fentanyl\r\n[doctor] you know we can refer you to pain medicine if it really is getting that complicated but for this current period we're gon na put you on some robaxin it's gon na be fifteen hundred milligrams and you're gon na take that six to eight hours every six to eight hours and that really should help kinda relax the muscles in the area take off some of that tension and really help with that pain if you're noticing that the robaxin still is n't helping maybe then we can start we can like start using like a heat pad or maybe some icyhot the biofreeze is a really good one to kinda help with that and then we will refer you to physical therapy i think with the mri we can start evaluating maybe some additional steps so rather than you having to like take that fentanyl because i do n't want you to be in danger right like people i do n't want you to get rubbed so what we could explore are local injections right and we can refer you to pain medication and see about like locally injecting the area and that should be able to help you out hopefully with this\r\n[patient] i ca n't go to work like this\r\n[doctor] okay so if it's if it's that bad let's wait for the mri result we're gon na give you off for work because you know you ca n't move and we'll see what the mri says about what whether or not we can get you like true local injections in the moment is that alright for now\r\n[patient] yeah\r\n[doctor] okay okay any other questions\r\n[patient] not right now\r\n[doctor] alright",
