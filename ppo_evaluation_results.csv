[doctor] alright how about your appetite are you hungry or or not as hungry
[patient] i i would say about his that that's pretty much unchanged
[doctor] okay your appetite is unchanged alright what about your water consumption
[patient] that i'm sorry what did you say
[doctor] no it's fine how about your water consumption
[patient] yes but i've been drinking a lot more water and i do realize that i i wake up sometimes during the night to you know use the restroom to pee more than i normally do
[doctor] okay so we have noticed an increase in urine output okay how do you have like any normal activities are you playing any sports
[patient] yeah i ride i ride a bike every so often
[doctor] okay
[patient] so good yeah
[doctor] okay and are you like watching any other sports like did you watch march madness
[patient] no sorry
[doctor] be still my heart okay that's fine i'll forgive you so
[patient] thank you
[doctor] okay but how is school like are you like are are things going well like are you enjoying like your your time there
[patient] yeah school is actually going well gotten good grades
[doctor] nice
[patient] although my my physics teachers socks cheese
[doctor] they usually do anybody who chooses to engage in physics for the rest of their life i question their choices it's fine okay but are you when you're like while you are at school like has anybody been sick i know like with you know covid has been going around but like have you noticed anybody like that sick all the time around you
[patient] sick all the time everybody is sick these days
[doctor] alright
[patient] so
[doctor] but what about at home how about your siblings are any of them sick
[patient] most of them are healthy yeah most of them are healthy although you know i have a brother who smokes i have told him not to smoke he does n't listen
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] house told not to smoke at the house but you know anyway
[doctor] okay so there is a smoker at home you know that does that does affect you so we might have to have a conversation with your brother and anybody else but it's good to know that people are n't sick i do see here though that you have kind of a a history of recurrent strep like you you seem to be having these sore throats a lot i think it says that you've had four in the last five months is that correct
[patient] yeah strep and bfs i'm not quite sure what it is just seems to come on you know i get this sore throat and fibroid i'm told i have strep
[doctor] okay
[patient] sometimes you know my doctor knows what he is doing strep everyday strep everyday but anyway if he says i have strep then i have strep
[doctor] i okay i respect that and i'm glad that you you listen to him at the end of the day that's always a good thing alright so now that we've gotten like kind of a lot of the history out of the way i do want to do my physical exam is that okay
[patient] sure
[doctor] alright so when i look in your throat like i'm not noticing any erythema no swelling your tonsils are midline so those look good when i'm feeling here on your neck i'm not appreciating any like lymphadenopathy no cervical adenopathy and like i wan na check those things because i just wan na make sure i'm not seeing any physical signs of like any kind of strep right now right i do n't want i wan na make sure you're not having an infection when i listen to your lungs i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales rhonchi that means i'm not hearing funky sounds your heart sounds great no murmur no rub no gallop when i press on your back remember you told me you had that left back pain when i press on it does it hurt
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright great no tenderness on palpation when i press on your abdomen are you feeling any pain
[patient] no
[doctor] alright no rebound no guarding that's great okay so based on my physical exam we are gon na have a couple conversations one that ct that your your primary care doctor the the one that you you question his judgment it is showing a couple things that we are a little concerned about it could be that these recurrent strep episodes that you've been having it looks like they are like potentially that they are caused something called glomerular nephritis right there's just some some swelling here and we have to be careful of something like that because it could lead to like kidney disease chronic kidney disease and we wan na make sure that we cut that off right so the first thing is i'm gon na refer you for your problem of glomerulonephritis i'm gon na refer you to an ent i want them to look at you and maybe consider taking out your tonsils to see if that could help with some of the recurrent strep though that you're feeling but i would like to leave that to them to make that decision for you and me we're gon na do some more like confirmations right i'm gon na order some labs i want several a lipid panel a ua a cmp a cbc a vitamin d and a tsh all of these things will give me more information about kind of like what's happening in your body right now in terms of like your hormones and you know your iron levels and to make sure that you are like getting all the nutrition that you need and that your body is operating appropriately i know that that was a lot of words but let me know what questions do you have about your care and your treatment
[patient] how much are all these tests going to cost
[doctor] they are going to be free ninety nine because your mom is paying for them
[patient] okay that's that's good to know
[doctor] yes
[patient] and when do i when do i have to do those tests
[doctor] i would prefer you to get them done as soon as possible so when you walk out of this room there is a a blood lab right next door i need you to go ahead and do some of those draws some of them i will need you to not have eaten we are gon na do them it's called fasting and you can make sure that you have n't eaten when you do but they will the lab techs will know so you will be able to knock out most of those today
[patient] okay and i'm not sure i will be able to do that today because i have a class right after this
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and right after that i have to go to work
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] you know if i told you i'm about changing jobs did i
[doctor] no you did n't mention that but one of the cool things about being a doctor is i can write you a note so you're gon na do it and then you can go to the class and we could figure it but like it's really cool that you're changing jobs i'm happy for you i hope you know that like it's always great to be able to make some income and make some decisions that means that you'll be able to start paying for your test soon uh
[patient] well yeah this new job there is no insurance and my old boss sucks so i'm hoping i'll get a new boss and you know hopefully some free food with with this ut because it's had a restaurant so we'll we'll see how that goes
[doctor] we might have to have a conversation about the free food at the restaurant if we do n't get some of these infections under control because your salt intake is about to be very important okay
[patient] got it
[doctor] alright okay so do you have any more questions before i send my nurse in
[patient] do i need to get a shot today

[patient] it did that six months ago it has not done that so far this time
[doctor] okay alright now tell me a little bit about when was the last time you saw your nephrologist
[patient] about about a month ago
[doctor] okay because as you know you know we we do talk about the fact that you have some kidney dysfunction about stage three so it's gon na be important for you to continue to follow up with your kidney doctor now are you how are you doing staying away from things like motrin and advil i know that you had had some knee pain in the past and you know how are you doing staying away from those medications
[patient] yeah everybody has told me not to use it so i do n't except when i have pretty bad pain i had an episode about a week ago some pain in my feet actually and i i had to take motrin to get rid of it so yeah i took motrin for a while and i stopped as quickly as i could
[doctor] okay now are you able to take tylenol do you not feel any relief from tylenol when you take it
[patient] yeah tylenol's lovely it just is not very effective

[patient] mean neither
[doctor] right so we'll have to you know really work on that now tell me a little bit about are you watching the potassium and stuff in your diet

[doctor] okay yeah so you want
[patient] i did n't know what high potassium foods are
[doctor] okay i'm sorry i've never talked to you about that in the past i that's my fault so yeah so you wan na make sure you stay away from things like bananas oranges you know potatoes have lots of potassium that type of thing and so you know because with your kidney function you know that can cause your potassium levels to go up because you do n't get rid of the potassium as you should you know
[patient] something to eat
[doctor] what's that
[patient] is there anything left is there anything left over that i ca n't eat

Shortness of breath.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of coronary disease, acute myocardial infarction in 2018, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, and knee pain. He denies a history of gout.

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports placement of a coronary artery stent in the right coronary artery in 2018.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that he is a fan of basketball.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking Lasix 40 mg once a day.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Respiratory: Reports shortness of breath.
Genitourinary: Denies changes in urination.
Musculoskeletal: Reports swelling in bilateral lower extremities and great toe pain.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 135/80 mmHg.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Jugular venous distention up to approximately 9 cm. There are no carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Bibasilar crackles with occasional rhonchi that clears when coughing.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination of the lower extremities: 1 to 2+ pitting edema bilaterally.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Acute heart failure exacerbation.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient’s physical examination today suggests he is retaining fluid. His shortness of breath is also the result of an acute heart failure exacerbation. His recent dietary indiscretion may have contributed to this development.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained to the patient that he should increase his diuretic in the morning so that any increased urinary frequency will not interrupt his sleep at night. I encouraged the patient to limit his salt intake.
- Medical Treatment: The patient will increase his Lasix from 40 mg a day to 80 mg a day. We will see how he does with the increased dose in the morning before adding a second increased dose in the afternoon. Chest x-ray ordered to rule out any other etiologies.

2. Coronary artery disease.
- Medical Reasoning: He is doing well except for the heart failure exacerbation.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to limit his intake of salty foods.
- Medical Treatment: Repeat echocardiogram ordered for further evaluation of the heart murmur heard on his physical exam. I am going to call Dr. White and let them know that I want him to be seen by them.

3. Stage 3 chronic kidney disease.
- Medical Reasoning: This appears to be stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I reminded the patient it is important to routinely follow up with his nephrologist. I advised him that he should limit intake of any potassium rich foods including bananas, oranges, and potatoes as they can affect his kidney function. I also recommended he avoid the use of any anti-inflammatories such as Motrin or Advil as they can contribute to worsening kidney function. If his pain does not resolve with Tylenol, I want him to call me, and we can discuss some alternative medications or therapies.
- Medical Treatment: The patient was provided with a referral to a dietician for assistance with his dietary needs. Tylenol can be taken for pain. Complete metabolic panel is ordered to ensure kidney function is stable.

4. Possible gout flare.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient’s recent great toe pain may have been a possible gout flare related to his chronic kidney disease.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained that there is an alternative medication he could take to protect his kidney function that would not result in a gout flare.
- Medical Treatment: Uric acid test ordered.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

I want him to call me in 2 days and let me know how his weight has been with increasing the diuretic. If he starts to have worsening shortness of breath in the next 2 days, I recommend he call me as we may have to admit him to the hospital for intravenous diuretics.","Generate a concise medical summary focusing on key findings and treatment plans.

[patient] yeah i've had the boot for about six weeks i first noticed it when i put on a pair of shoes that were little bit too tight i felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister i did n't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and i just had been walking on the front part of my foot i started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and i noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unroofed or the the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so and barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you he started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and i never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature it was about ninety nine point seven and then at one point i had to put on an extra blanket in bed because i had some chills and when i started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and i'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it
[doctor] okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics
[patient] i think he called in ten days' worth and i'm on day six or seven right now i know i've got about two or three days left
[doctor] okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now
[patient] yeah it was it was stinging initially like i had just done something small but at this point it's it's really like throbbing it's almost like there is a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard and i've noticed that every time that i push that i feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap and then noticed that i've been coughing a lot the last two days and then i've noticed that i've had like difficult time catching my breath when i'm walking around the house and so it's almost like two different things going on at this point
[doctor] okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that
[patient] yeah my my a1c is six point seven it's pretty well controlled
[doctor] okay
[patient] i used to be on an insulin pump and i had an a1c that at one point was like thirteen but we worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it's at now i've been six point seven for probably two years now and i rarely have a blood sugar that goes over two hundred i check two or three times a day if i feel weird i'll check it again but i noticed my sugars have probably been trending in the three to four hundreds the last two weeks and then i had one spike at one point at like five or six hundred that got our attention and i think that's also what made my wife call the primary care doc
[doctor] okay now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park
[patient] yeah we actually hiked to charlie's bunion about a week before this i've had a new pair of diabetic shoes and inserts i get those every year i changed the inserts every three or four months i mean i've been in cruise control as far as that goes for some time i did get a new pair of shoes the prosthetist told me to check my feet every day for the first week or two which we did i did go hiking about the third or fourth day and i think that might be what caused it as i just went too far when we were hiking but yeah the trails are the trails are gorgeous they're open it's time to to be outside and i'm sorta stuck with this right now
[doctor] absolutely yeah my wife and i like to go back there and and hike those trails as well so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam for your vital signs i do recognize a slight fever however your vitals themselves look good now on your foot exam i do recognize the necrotic wound on your heel as you mentioned it is present it's approximately two by two centimeters i i do recognize the sloughing of the of the tissue as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area as well as erythemia so now unfortunately i do also smell the odor you are correct it is it does it is odds but i do not appreciate any bony exposure now on vascular exam i do have bilateral palpable pulses femorally and popliteal pulses are present however i do n't recognize a palpable pulse dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial however i did use the doppler and they are present via doppler now i'm gon na press on the actual affected area of the wound do you have any pain there
[patient] i do n't feel that right there
[doctor] okay i'm gon na review the results of your right foot x-ray that we did when you came in today the good news is i do n't see any evidence of osteomyelitis meaning that there is no infection of the bone so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for this nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer i'm going to order a test to check blood supply for this wound also i'm going to do a debridement today in the office we may have to look at we are going to do a culture and we may have to look at different antibiotic therapy i am concerned about the redness that's moving up your leg as well as this the the swelling and pain that you have in your calf so we're gon na monitor this very closely i wan na see you again in seven days and then as far as your diabetes is concerned i do want you to follow up with your endocrinologist and make sure that we do continue to keep your hemoglobin a1c below seven and we're gon na need to closely monitor your blood sugars since we're going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and and potentially some other medications any other questions comments or concerns before i have the nurse come in we're gon na prep you for that procedure
[patient] no not really so you're gon na continue the antibiotics that i'm on and possibly extend or call in a new antibiotic depending on the culture
[doctor] correct
[patient] if i heard
[doctor] yep that's correct so what we're gon na do is you said you're six days in do a ten or twelve day course so we're gon na go ahead and continue your antibiotics therapy that your pcp put you on i do want to get the culture back and then we'll make the determination as far as additional or changing that antibiotic therapy

Non-healing ulcer on his right foot.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicholas Gutierrez is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a non-healing ulcer on his right foot. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 6 weeks ago, after wearing a pair of shoes that were too tight.

Today, he describes a burning, stinging, and throbbing sensation. The patient reports a blister on the pad of the plantar aspect of his foot around his heel. He explains that he has been ambulating on the anterior aspect of his foot. He explains that the top part of the skin of the blister detached, which revealed a thick, soft, mushy skin associated with unpleasant smell and yellow drainage. The patient called his primary care physician, who referred him to our office. He was prescribed a 10-day course of antibiotics approximately 6 days ago. He experienced chills and a fever of 99.7 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient denies any nausea or vomiting. He states that when he started the antibiotics, his foot began to feel pretty good. However, he has now noticed that his foot has turned black around the outside of the wound, and he is experiencing cramping in his calf muscle as well. He also reports a burning red streak that was coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle. While palpating his calf, he has noted stiffness in the muscle that is now up to the patella. The patient reports that he has been coughing a lot over the last 2 days. He has experienced shortness of breath with ambulation around the house. He reports that he purchases new diabetic shoes yearly and changes the inserts every 3 to 4 months.

The patient is diabetic and has diabetic neuropathy. He explains that his blood sugar has been trending in the 300 to 400's over the last 2 weeks. At one point, he had a blood sugar spike to either 500 or 600. He states that his last hemoglobin A1c was 6.7, which has been his average for approximately 2 years. The patient checks his blood sugar 2 to 3 times per day and rarely has a blood sugar that goes over 200. He explains that he used to be on an insulin pump and had an A1c that at one point was 13. He states that he worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it is now.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports a history of diabetic neuropathy.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient enjoys hiking.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports subjective fever and chills
Respiratory: Reports cough and shortness of breath with ambulation.
Gastrointestinal: Denies nausea and vomiting.
Musculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain and right calf cramping.
Skin: Reports right foot ulcer with yellow foul smelling drainage, and red streaking coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle.

VITALS

Temperature is slightly elevated.
Vitals are otherwise good.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Edema and pain in calf. Bilateral palpable femoral and papiteal pulses are present. I do not recognize a palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulse; however, they are present via Doppler.
MSK: Examination of the right foot: The necrotic wound on his heel is present. It is approximately 2 cm x 2 cm. I do recognize the sloughing of the tissue, as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area, and erythema. An odor is present from the wound. I do not appreciate any bony exposure now. No pain to palpation in the effected area.

RESULTS

3 views of the right foot were taken today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis or infection.

ASSESSMENT

Right non-healing diabetic foot ulcer.
Diabetes.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that I do not see any evidence of osteomyelitis. I am concerned about the redness that is moving up his leg, as well as the swelling, and pain that he has in his calf. I have recommended that we obtain a venous ultrasound to check his blood supply for the wound. I have also recommended that we perform a debridement of the wound today. We may have to obtain a culture and look at different antibiotic therapy. I am recommending that he continue with antibiotics that his primary care physician prescribed.

In regard to his diabetes, I have advised him to follow up with his endocrinologist to ensure that we do continue to keep his hemoglobin A1c below 7. We will need to closely monitor his blood sugar since we are going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and potentially some other medications depending on the culture results.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 7 days to check on his progress.","Generate a concise medical summary focusing on key findings and treatment plans.

"[doctor] patient's name is diana scott . date of birth , 12/8/1920 . the date of service is 7/9/2021 . this is a new patient note .
[doctor] good afternoon . how are you today ?
[patient] i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] good . well , what brings you in to see me today ?
[patient] well , my doctor says that i have a heart murmur .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so i do n't know how big a heart murmur i have , or really even what it is .
[doctor] okay . so how long have you had that for ? do you have any idea , or is that completely new as far as you know ?
[patient] yeah , she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur . so of course , i'm worried as well .
[doctor] got it . okay . and are you having any symptoms at all ?
[patient] i do n't think so . i do n't know what symptoms i should be having .
[doctor] okay . well , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one . so i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to ?
[patient] no , i definitely do n't .
[doctor] okay . and do you notice that you have any chest pain or f- feel shortness of breath ?
[patient] no , i do n't have any chest pain . um , my problem is i have severe pains in my legs , and so she had me going for a chest x-ray , and that was just last week .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and so i started taking pain pills for my legs .
[doctor] okay , got it , for the legs . and do you feel short of breath at all ?
[patient] if i walk too fast or too long , or if i tried to drink a whole glass of water without stopping , then yeah , i do get short of breath that way .
[doctor] okay . and how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ?
[patient] well , i do have a walker now , so i do n't know . maybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or i walk around the culdesac .
[doctor] got it . all right .
[patient] so it is n't that bothersome to me at all . um , maybe more if i try to overdo it .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] then i , um , i get short of breath if i do overdo it though .
[doctor] okay , got it . and so how different would you say , um , that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago ?
[patient] i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about six months ago . before that i did n't notice anything at all .
[doctor] okay . so do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ?
[patient] my legs have been severe for about a month now .
[doctor] okay . and how about , do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ?
[patient] yeah . so i do take a pill for that when it does get bad .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] yeah , and i do n't take it every day , only when i do feel dizzy .
[doctor] okay . and so how about any passing out at all ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay , good . and how about irregular heartbeats ? do you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ?
[patient] i do n't notice it at all .
[doctor] okay , great . and how about any swelling in the legs at all ?
[patient] yeah , my ankles swell .
[doctor] okay . and how long has this been going on ?
[patient] um , i would say for probably six months . but it goes up and down , and sometimes it's worse than other times .
[doctor] okay . and how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ?
[patient] um , i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh a 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds .
[doctor] mm-hmm . okay .
[patient] um , but that's been going down gradually for about a year .
[doctor] okay . and then how about any fevers , chills or anything else that's , that's going on that you can think of ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] good . so mainly it sounds like you came in , um , mostly because of the murmur . is that right ? and sort of just kind of seeing what things look like ?
[patient] yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication .
[doctor] okay . and so fatigue as well . and have you ever had any testing of your heart done ?
[patient] i'm not really sure .
[doctor] okay . it does look like you've had a decent number of sh- , uh , surgeries here , ?
[patient] yeah , you name it .
[doctor] all right . well , i wo n't make you repeat them since i do have a good record . um , but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ? all right . got them . and then , are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay , good . and looking at your family history , it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack . is that correct ?
[patient] it was actually my son , not my brother .
[doctor] okay , i'll make that adjustment .
[patient] um , but my brother did have a stroke . but that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes , and my eldest sister did have a heart problem as well .
[doctor] okay , i see .
[patient] yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family .
[doctor] okay . all right . well , it looks like also that you never smoked . that's excellent . and then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] all right . well , let's do a quick exam .
[patient] all right . sounds good .
[doctor] all right . well , for physical exam , please use the regular template . all right , please just breathe normally . great . and now take a few deep breaths for me . all right . do you feel okay ? are you feeling any dizziness or anything ?
[patient] no , i feel fine .
[doctor] okay , great . all right . well , that is it for the exam .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so what i'm thinking is , let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram . it's a very common test and it just takes a picture of your heart . and it'll let me see how well your heart is actually working .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i can order that for today . um , do you have time to complete that ? it should n't take too long .
[patient] yes , that's fine . i have time .
[doctor] okay , great . so we will complete that today , um , to assess your overall cardiac structure and function , as well as , uh , the valve view of where diseased .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and some hospital outcomes and what we might suggest to fix that out , i'll go over that . so one possible suspicion i'm having is it's called , um , aortic stenosis , and that just means that one of your main valves of your heart has narrowed a bit and the valve does n't really open , um , quite fully . and this could just reduce or block the blood flow from your heart into the main artery of your body , and that's called the aorta , into the rest of your body .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and if this is severe , then we might wan na perform a procedure called the transcatheter aortic valve replacement , or we just call it tavr . and it is a minimally invasive procedure to replace the valve .
[patient] well , i would have to think about that . i'm not too sure i'd wan na do that , given my age of all .
[doctor] yeah , sure , no problem . and we do n't have to make any decisions today , just , you know , wanted to go over a couple of these things . um , but sometimes we can also perform a surgical aortic valve replacement , or it's called an savr . but really , because of your age and medical history , um , unfortunately , that would n't be a good option for you .
[patient] i see . okay . well , i guess we'll see , um , what you see from , from the , um , test .
[doctor] yeah , agreed . okay . and , um , so couple other things real quick . so it looked like your blood pressure looked really good today . so we're not going to change your amlodipine or lisinopril . so just continue taking those as you are currently .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] and then , it also looks like you're taking about 20 milligrams of simvastatin for your lipids . and i will pr- , um , defer to your pcp . however , given you are having leg pain in both your legs , and given your age and no history of coronary artery d- , artery disease , it is possible that you might be able to stop your statin .
[patient] really ?
[doctor] yeah , um , possibly . he would have to evaluate you , but it is certainly something to discuss with him . so i will send over the results of the echocardiogram and also my recommendations and then you guys can talk about the statin .
[patient] okay , that sounds great . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . and then , um , lastly , your hyperthyroidism , uh , i see you're taking levothyroxine . and again , no change here and you can just keep taking that as you have them .
[patient] okay , i will .
[doctor] all right . so we will see you back here in about three or four weeks to discuss the results and your next steps . um , and we'll , uh , take care of your echocardiogram today . um , any questions ?
[patient] not that i can think of . thank you so much . and i think it looks good .
[doctor] okay , awesome . all right . well , have a good rest of your day , and we'll see you soon .

Heart murmur.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Diana Scott is a 100-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of a heart murmur.

Ms. Scott has been recently diagnosed with a “new, worrisome” heart murmur. She denies chest pain, syncope, palpitations, fevers, or chills. She reports shortness of breath if she walks too fast, too long, or tries to drink a whole glass of water without stopping. The patient requires a walker and can walk around her cul-de-sac or to the end of the driveway without shortness of breath. Compared to 6 months ago, her functioning has declined 20-30%. Prior to 6 months, symptoms were absent. For the past month she has been experiencing severe, bilateral leg pain, which was limiting her mobility. She did see her doctor last week who completed a chest x-ray and prescribed pain medicine. Occasionally, she feels dizzy but takes medication for this and it subsides. Her ankles have been swelling for the past 6 months, but the swelling fluctuates day to day. Her weight has been slowly decreasing over the past year, with her current weight at 120 pounds, previous weight was 130 pounds. She also reports feeling “overly tired” but attributes this to her polypharmacy.

The patient is unsure if she has completed any cardiovascular testing.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Requires a walker to ambulate.

FAMILY HISTORY

Son had a myocardial infarction.
Brother had a stroke and has diabetes.

ALLERGIES

No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Elderly, no acute distress.

Cardiovascular
Normal S1, S2 preserved, irregular rhythm and normal rate. 4/6 systolic murmur at the RUSB with mild radiation to the carotids.

Musculoskeletal
Lower extremity edema

Neurologic
Gait normal for age.

RESULTS

EKG
Impression: Sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern.

ASSESSMENT

• Cardiac murmur.
• PVCs.
• Hypertension.
• Hyperlipidemia.
• Hypothyroid.
• Lightheadedness/dizziness.

PLAN

Cardiac murmur
Diana has a 4/6 systolic murmur at the RUSB with mild radiation to the carotids. This is most likely representative of aortic stenosis. She does have symptoms including a significant increase in fatigue over the last 6 months, shortness of breath, and some lightheadedness. This could be due to severe aortic stenosis, however, her S2 is relatively preserved which would be more consistent with moderate. She is unsure if she has had an echocardiogram, although some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction, so it is possible that she had one as some point in the past. We will order a repeat echocardiogram today to assess overall cardiac structure and function as well as valvular disease. If she does truly have severe aortic stenosis, I briefly discussed a TAVR procedure today as she is not a candidate for a surgical AVR given her age co-morbidities and frailty. She is unsure if she would be interested in this, but we will assess first with the echocardiogram and then discuss further at follow-up. She does not appear significantly volume overloaded today.

PVCs
Her referral mentions tachycardia. Her EKG today shows sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern. She does not have any significant palpitations. We will check an echocardiogram to assess overall cardiac structure and function. Depending on results as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis, we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation or possibly a heart monitor to assess the overall burden of PVCs. At this point, she is asymptomatic, so we will start with the echocardiogram only.

Hypertension
She is taking amlodipine and lisinopril. We will continue these as is.

Hyperlipidemia
This is managed by her PCP. She is on simvastatin 20 mg. She is having bilateral leg pain over the past month. This could be related to the simvastatin possibly and given her age, it would not be unreasonable to stop the simvastatin, but I will defer to her PCP. She has no known CAD but if we were to do a TAVR evaluation and this was discovered, a statin would be indicated.

Hypothyroidism
She takes levothyroxine for supplementation and will continue this as is.

Lightheadedness/dizziness
She is on meclizine for this. It is possible that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness are related to the aortic stenosis, and we will do an echocardiogram as noted above. She is also having some PVCs on her EKG, which could be contributing, but she does not feel palpitations. We will consider a monitor but start with the echocardiogram first as noted above.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow-up in 3 to 4 weeks after her echocardiogram is done to discuss results and next steps.

[doctor] good afternoon. how are you today?
[patient] i'm good, thank you.
[doctor] good. well, what brings you in to see me today?
[patient] well, my doctor says that i have a heart murmur.
[doctor] okay.
[patient] so i don't know how big a heart murmur i have, or really even what it is.
[doctor] okay. so how long have you had that for? do you have any idea, or is that completely new as far as you know?
[patient] yeah, she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur. so of course, i'm worried as well.
[doctor] got it. okay. and are you having any symptoms at all?
[patient] i don't think so. i don't know what symptoms i should be having.
[doctor] okay. well, so you are 100, so we can't really get around that one. so i expect that you probably don't move quite as fast as maybe you used to?
[patient] no, i definitely don't.
[doctor] okay. and do you notice that you have any chest pain or f- feel shortness of breath?
[patient] no, i don't have any chest pain. um, my problem is i have severe pains in my legs, and so she had me going for a chest x-ray, and that was just last week.
[doctor] okay.
[patient] and so i started taking pain pills for my legs.
[doctor] okay, got it, for the legs. and do you feel short of breath at all?
[patient] if i walk too fast or too long, or if i tried to drink a whole glass of water without stopping, then yeah, i do get short of breath that way.

[patient] well i've been having this sharp pain on the right side of my abdomen below my ribs for the last several days
[doctor] i saw my doctor and they ordered a cat scan and said i had a kidney stone and sent me to see a urologist okay well does the pain move or or or go anywhere or does it stay right in that same spot yeah it feels like it goes to my lower abdomen in into my groin okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go it comes and goes when it comes it's it's pretty it's pretty bad i feel like i ca n't find a comfortable position okay and do you notice any any pain when you urinate or when you pee
[patient] yeah it kinda burns a little bit
[doctor] okay do you notice any blood i do n't think there is any you know frank blood but the urine looks a little dark sometimes okay and what have you taken for the pain i have taken some tylenol but it has n't really helped okay and do you have any nausea vomiting any fever chills i feel nauseated but i'm not vomiting okay is anyone in your in your family had kidney stones yes my father had them and have you had kidney stones before yeah so i i've i've had them but i've been able to pass them but this is taking a lot longer okay well i'm just gon na go ahead and do a physical examination i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm going to explain what what those mean when i'm done okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so on physical examination of the abdomen on a abdominal exam there is no tenderness to palpation there is no evidence of any rebound or guarding there is no peritoneal signs there is positive cva tenderness on the right flank so essentially what that means russell is that you know you have some tenderness over your over your right kidney and that just means that you might have some inflammation there so i i reviewed the results of the ct scan of your abdomen that the primary care doctor ordered and it does show a . five centimeter kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter so this the ureter is the duct in which urine passes between the kidney and the bladder there's no evidence of what we call hydronephrosis this means you know swelling of the kidney which is good means that things are still able to get through so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan okay so for your first problem of this acute nephrolithiasis or kidney stone i i wan na go ahead and recommend that you push fluids to help facilitate urination and peeing to help pass the stone i'm going to prescribe oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours as needed for pain you can continue to alternate that with some tylenol i'm going to give you a strainer that you can use to strain your urine so that we can see it see the stone when it passes and we can send it for some some tests if that happens i'm also gon na order what we call a basic metabolic panel a urinalysis and a urine culture now i wan na see you again in one to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we'll have to discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy which is essentially a shock wave procedure in which we sedate you and use shock waves to break up the stone to help it pass we could also do what we call a ureteroscopy which is a small telescope small camera used to go up to to the urethra and bladder and up into the ureter to retrieve the stone so let's see how you do over the next week and i want you to contact me if you're having worsening symptoms okay okay sounds good thank you","CHIEF COMPLAINT

"[doctor] this is philip gutierrez date of birth 1/12/1971 . he is a 50-year-old male here for a second opinion regarding the index finger on the right hand . [patient] he had a hyperextension injury of that index finger during a motor vehicle accident in march of this year . he was offered an injection of the a1 pulley region , but did not want any steroid because of the reaction to dexamethasone , which causes his heart to race . [doctor] he was scheduled to see dr. alice davis , which it does n't appear he did . he had an mri of that finger because there was concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of fds tendon end . [patient] he has been seen at point may orthopedics largely by the physical therapy staff and a pr pa at that institution . at that practice , an mri was obtained on 4/24/2021 . [doctor] which showed just focal soft tissue swelling over the right index mcp joint partial thickness tear of the right fds and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the fdp and fds tendons . radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index mcp joint were intact as the mcp joint capsule . extensor tendons also deemed intact . his x-rays four views of the right hand today show no bony abnormalities , joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand . no soft tissue shadows of concern . no arthritis . hi , how are you mr . gutierrez ? i'm good how about you ? [patient] well how can i help you today ? so i was a passenger in a car that was rear-ended and we were hit multiple times i felt two bumps which slugged me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger . [doctor] so hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards ? [patient] i do n't really know , i just felt like it felt like i laid on my finger and so i felt like it went back and it's been hurting since about march and it's been like that ever , ever since the wreck happened , so i and i ca n't make a fist but sometimes the pain is unbearable and like even driving hurts . [doctor] okay . so this was march of this year , so maybe about 3 months ago ? [patient] yeah . and it's still swollen . so i was seeing an orthopedist and they sent me to an occupational therapist and i've been doing therapy with them and then they sent me to go back and get an mri , so i went and got the mri then they told me that the mri came back . and i said i had a tear in my finger , but he was n't gon na give me an injection because the injection was going to make the tear worse . [doctor] mm-hmm . [patient] and then after he got the mri he said that i have a tear in my finger and that he did n't want to do surgery , but he would do an injection . then i'm thinking that you told me you would n't do an injection in there and then the occupational therapy says it's because of the tear , and then they do n't want me to keep rubbing the thing and doing things with my hand , so i feel like i'm not getting medical care really . [doctor] hmmm yeah , i see that . [patient] so i came to see if you could do anything for this hand because i am right handed and i kinda need that hand . [doctor] mm-hmm what do you do for a living ? [patient] i'm an x-ray tech . [doctor] wow so do you have any diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis ? [patient] nope . do you take any chronic medications of significance ? [doctor] i do take a blood pressure pill and that's it . [patient] okay and it looks like you suffer from itching with the methyl prednisone ? [doctor] that's correct . alright , well , i'm gon na scoot up closer and just take a quick look at your hand . alright , so lean over here . alright , so on this exam today , we have a very pleasant , cooperative , healthy male , no distress . his heart rate is regular rate , rhythm , 2+ radial pulse . no swelling or bruise , bruising in the palm over the volar surface of his index finger . normal creases , slightly diminished over the tip of the index finger compared to the middle finger . [patient] his index finger rest in a 10 degree pip flexed position alright , is that uncomfortable to correct that and is it uncomfortable now here ? [doctor] yeah when you push on it , yeah . [patient] alright , how about here ? there it's not . [doctor] okay , not as bad . [patient] yeah , it feels little numb . [doctor] gotcha , alright , bend , bend the tip of this finger , bend it as hard as you can , keep bending , keep bending , alright , straighten it out , [patient] alright , and now bend it for me as best you can . my goodness , feels like it's it's tearing in there . okay , okay . well , bend the tip of this finger and bend it as hard as you can , keep bending , alright , straighten that out and now bend it for me as best as you can , [doctor] alright , good . now bend that finger and i'm going to pull , put it down like this and then bend that finger for me , okay , sorry , can you bend it for me ? alright , now make a fist , great , so relax the finger , alright , so just keep it , keep when i bend the finger , we're just going to bend that finger where it meets the hand , is that okay there ? [patient] ow , ah . [doctor] okay , okay , so all the hurt it seems is stretching because you have n't been doing this for so long , so you know what i mean so you're going to have to start really doing that . [patient] well , i've tried , i even bought myself a splint . [doctor] well , but a splint does n't help move you , it actually immobilizes you . [patient] okay , i thought it would straighten it out . [doctor] no , no , so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me as hard as you can and keep going , going , alright , so , so you're okay . alright , so i would say the following that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds the flexor digitorum , superficialis which is the least important of the two . [patient] okay . [doctor] now there are two halves of it , so it's the partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important and the other one is just fine . so the good one is good ? [patient] yes , correct . so the one that goes all the way to the tip is good . [doctor] okay , good . [patient] yeah , so you know i think what you have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the fds tendon , [doctor] blocking excursion of these other tendons that they ca n't get through to the pulley . [patient] okay . alright . [doctor] so what i would recommend what we try is a cortisone injection and i would avoid the dexamethasone because i saw you have a little reaction to that . but we could use the betamethasone which is a sellastone i've gotten another methylprednisolone and that itching like crazy . [patient] did it , yeah , this one is water soluble and i think it's fairly low toxicity , but high benefit and i think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that finger . [doctor] alright , we'll give it a try . good . so you do the shot and it's going to take about 3 to 5 days before it starts feeling better and then probably over the next couple of weeks , it'll start feeling even better . [patient] perfect . [doctor] alright , so take advantage of that . you got ta start moving the finger . you're not gon na tear anything or break a bone because your intensors , extensors are intact . but your collateral ligaments are intact , so you got a sore finger . i'm going to try to help as much as i can with this soreness part and then you have to do all the stiff part . [patient] the lady in occupational therapy tried some maneuvers to straighten the finger out , but it even hurt after i left . the whole thing just swelled up . [doctor] hmmm okay . so it was injured and you had scar tissue and then you had posttraumatic inflammation and so this will help some with all of that . it's not going to make it to where your finger is like my finger does n't hurt at all , but it will make it to where at least tolerable to where you can make some gains and we actually might need to repeat this as well . [patient] well i'll be able to drive , i drove myself here today so . [doctor] yeah , it may feel a little weird , but it's totally safe for you to drive . okay , good . [patient] so for mr . gutierrez , just put that he has a posttraumatic rather severe stenosing tenosynovitis of his right index finger . [doctor] and the plan is steroid injection today , do a trigger injection , but i'm using a cc of betamethasone . so mr . gutierrez , do you have therapy scheduled or set up ? [patient] not at the moment . [doctor] alright , well , i mean you know that you need to move that finger and i think to the degree that they can help you do that . so , i want you to move that finger finger , but i think it would be beneficial for you to have an accountability . [patient] so at least you know to check in with them once a week with somebody . [doctor] okay that's kinda why i'm here for you , tell me what needs to be done , you know . [patient] yeah , so i'll write you out , [doctor] an outpatient prescription . i think if you go back to the same people where you were before , i'm hoping that after this injection , you're going to be able to do a whole lot more with them . so let's do outpatient , once a week for 6 weeks , [patient] and then full active and passive range of motion is the goal with no restrictions . [doctor] alright sounds like a plan . [patient] alright , well i will have the nurse set up the injection procedure and we'll and i'll be back shortly . [doctor] thanks document . right trigger finger injection template , attempted to inject 1 cc of celestone with half a cc of lidocaine however , the patient had a dramatic and violent , painful reaction to the introduction of the needle with contortions of the hand and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick . needle was withdrawn . the patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath . we attempted a second time for a similar injection using the same technique with 1 cc of celestone and half a cc of lidocaine . [patient] a small palmar vein bled a scant amount , which was cleaned up and band-aid applied . reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger . recommended icing and it this evening and taking ibuprofen .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right index finger hyperextension injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion regarding evaluation of the right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in 03/2021.

In summary, the patient was the passenger in a vehicle that was rear-ended. He reports they were hit multiple times as he felt 2 bumps which caused his to sling forward hyperextending his right index finger. He was offered an injection of the A1 pulley region, but he did not want any steroid due to a reaction to dexamethasone that causes his heart to race. The patient was scheduled to see Dr. Alice Davis, but he has not seen his yet. The patient has been seen at Point May Orthopedics, by the physical therapy staff and a physician assistant at that practice. He underwent an MRI of the right index finger because they were concerned about a capsular strain plus or minus a rupture of the ""FDS tendon.""

The patient states that he is unable to make a fist secondary to pain and swelling in the right index finger. He describes a pulling, tearing sensation in the right index finger. The pain is exacerbated by driving. He notes that he has been wearing a right index finger splint.

The patient denies any history of diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. He reports only taking medication for hypertension and denies taking any other chronic medications of significance. He also notes methylprednisolone causes his to itch.

Ms. Gutierrez is employed as an x-ray technician.

Exam of the right hand, there is no swelling or ecchymosis in the palm on the volar surface of his index finger. Normal creases are noted. Index finger rests in a 10 degree PIP joint flexed position with discomfort upon correction. Bilateral extremities 2+ radial pulses.

RESULTS

X-rays today, 4 views of the right hand, show no bony abnormalities. Joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand. No soft tissue shadows of concern. No arthritis.

MRI of the right index finger performed on 04/24/2021. Independent review of the images shows focal soft tissue swelling over the right index MCP joint, partial-thickness tear of the right FDS, and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the FDP and FDS tendons. Radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index MCP joint were intact as was the MCP joint capsule. The extensor tendons were also deemed intact.

ASSESSMENT

• Stenosing tenosynovitis of right index finger.

Ms. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion of his right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in March of this year. The findings of his examination are consistent with rather severe post-traumatic stenosing tenosynovitis.

PLAN

The patient and I had a lengthy discussion regarding his history, symptoms, and radiographic findings. We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of stenosing tenosynovitis and the anatomy of the flexor tendons and pulley system in the hand. I explained to the patient that the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon was clearly intact and that He is suffering from post-traumatic inflammation around the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon blocking excursion of the flexor tendons to the A1 pulley.

Treatment options were discussed including conservative management with corticosteroid injections and their statistical effectiveness. Surgical correction was also briefly discussed, although I recommend exhausting non-operative measures with a minimum of 2 injections before proceeding with surgery. I recommended a right index trigger finger cortisone injection today, and the patient elected to proceed. I also recommend that the patient report to occupational therapy once a week for the next 6 weeks to work on full active and passive right index finger range of motion with no restrictions.

The patient verbalizes understanding with the treatment plan and agrees. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction today.

PROCEDURE

Right index trigger finger injection.
The patient understands the risks and benefits and elected to proceed, signed consent obtained. An attempt was made to inject 1.0 cc of Celestone with 0.5 cc of lidocaine. However, the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle with contortions of the hand and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick. Therefore, the needle was withdrawn. The patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath. We attempted a 2nd time for a similar injection using the same technique with 1.0 cc of Celestone and 0.5 cc of lidocaine. There was a small palmar vein that bled a scant amount, which was cleaned up off the back of the patient's hand. A Band-Aid was applied. He was reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger. I recommended icing it this evening and taking ibuprofen.

INSTRUCTIONS

Occupational therapy as prescribed.

[patient] he had a hyperextension injury of that index finger during a motor vehicle accident in march of this year. he was offered an injection of the a1 pulley region, but did not want any steroid because of the reaction to dexamethasone, which causes his heart to race. [doctor] he was scheduled to see dr. alice davis, which it doesn't appear he did. he had an mri of that finger because there was concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of fds tendon end. [patient] he has been seen at point may orthopedics largely by the physical therapy staff and a pr pa at that institution. at that practice, an mri was obtained on 4/24/2021.

[patient] well how can i help you today? so i was a passenger in a car that was rear-ended and we were hit multiple times i felt two bumps which slugged me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger. [doctor] so hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards? [patient] i don't really know, i just felt like it felt like i laid on my finger and so i felt like it went back and it's been hurting since about march and it's been like that ever, ever since the wreck happened, so i and i can't make a fist but sometimes the pain is unbearable and like even driving hurts.

Kayla reports that today is a good day for her acne. She denies any significant acne present on the chest or back. There are no associated symptoms, including no itching, bleeding, or pain.

The patient has been washing her face regularly. Her acne regimen includes washing her face in the morning with Persa-Gel and at night e.l.f. SuperClarify Cleanser along with toner and Persa-Gel. This regimen is somewhat helpful. She wears sunscreen in the summer SPF 30.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Lives with parents and sister. They have a dog, bird, and rabbits in the home. She is in the 7th grade and active in basketball, volleyball, and tap dancing.

FAMILY HISTORY

No significant family medical history.

Integumentary
Full exam is performed today except for under the underwear and under the bra. There are multiple benign nevi on the trunk and extremities. Scattered skin-colored papules, open and closed comedones, and erythematous papules on the face, primarily on the forehead, with also some on the central cheeks and chin. The chest and back are relatively spared. The remainder of examination is normal.

ASSESSMENT

• Comedonal acne.
• Multiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.

Kayla Ward is a 15-year-old female seen today for new acne evaluation. Full skin examination revealed mild to moderate comedonal acne with a small inflammatory component and multiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.

PLAN

Comedonal acne.
We discussed the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment options. I recommend starting with topical therapy first. The patient was instructed to wash face every morning with a mild cleanser, then use a non-comedogenic moisturizer with sunscreen SPF 30 of higher. In the evening, wash face with same mild cleanser and allow to dry. Apply a thin layer of topical retinoid, Retin-A 0.1% gel, to acne prone areas. Start off using a few nights a week, slowly work up to using every night. If it is very expensive or not covered by insurance, you can try Differin gel over the counter. Your topical retinoid will cause sun sensitivity, so you will need to wear sunscreen when you are outside. It may also cause some dryness or irritation.

Multiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.
Reassurance given moles are normal in appearance and have no concerning characteristics. Will continue to monitor for progression or changes in 6 months.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow recommended cleaning regimen.
Start Retin-A 0.1% topical gel, apply to acne prone areas, titrate as instructed.
Follow up in 6 months.

"[doctor] hello larry how are you doing today
[patient] i've been better my primary care doctor wanted me to see you for this back pain that i've been having for a couple of years now
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i have tried so many things and just nothing seems to work
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that now do you remember what caused the pain initially
[patient] you know i never fell or was in an accident but i do remember it all happened like i started having back pain after i was moving furniture one weekend
[doctor] okay and now can you describe the pain for me
[patient] yeah it feels like a sharp stabbing pain in my back and it does go down even down to my right leg sometimes all the way down to my toe it feels like my big toe
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i also feel like i just ca n't get comfortable which is worse when i sit down okay yeah
[doctor] okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain
[patient] yeah i do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot
[doctor] okay
[patient] let me separate these
[doctor] and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area
[patient] no nothing like that
[doctor] okay now do you have any weakness
[patient] i would n't say i have any weakness no
[doctor] okay do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels
[patient] no
[doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you you have some tried tried some things in the past so tell me what were they
[patient] so i've tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me but that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery
[doctor] okay sure so tell me what is your day like
[patient] my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years
[doctor] okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf
[patient] yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back
[doctor] yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right
[patient] exactly
[doctor] well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions
[patient] no i ca n't recall any family members
[doctor] okay alright and do you smoke
[patient] not now i i quit about twenty years ago
[doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here
[patient] okay
[doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit
[patient] okay that's painful
[doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that
[patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time
[doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year
[patient] okay okay
[doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] alright sounds good
[doctor] alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection
[patient] alright thank you
[doctor] alright thank you

The onset of his pain began 2 years ago, after moving furniture. He denies any specific injury. The patient describes his pain as sharp and stabbing. He locates his pain to his lower back, which radiates distally into his right leg and occasionally into his great toe. Sitting will increase his pain and he notes he is unable to get comfortable. The patient also reports numbness and tingling, especially in his right leg that radiates distally to his foot. He adds that he tries to be as active as he can, however it has been difficult with his back pain. The patient adds that he has gained weight over the past year. He denies any loss of sensation in his genital or rectal area, weakness, or loss of bladder or bowel control.

In the past, he has attended physical therapy. The patient has also been prescribed pain medications, however they only provided temporary relief. He would like to avoid any surgical procedure at this time.

[doctor] okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day
[patient] we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so
[doctor] do you have any questions about that
[patient] yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just
[doctor] yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this
[patient] you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing
[doctor] if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound
[patient] that's fine
[doctor] great and then for your third problem of your diabetes i wan na just go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and continue you on the metformin one thousand milligrams twice a day it sounds like you're doing a good job since your blood sugars are running in the one twenties i do n't think we need to make any adjustments but we'll see what the hemoglobin a1c shows that gives us a an idea of what your blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis how does that sound
[patient] okay at what point time do you start kinda checking kidney function i've been told that metformin can possibly cause some kidney issues
[doctor] so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable
[patient] okay that'd be good
[doctor] okay anything else
[patient] not that i can think of at this time as soon as i leave
[doctor] well you know where to find me okay
[patient] alright

Integumentary
- Examination: There is evidence of a bull’s eye rash over the right knee.

RESULTS

Patient's previous kidney function is within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Tick bite.
- Medical Reasoning: My concern is that he might have Lyme disease based on the presentation of his right knee.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed blood testing to determine if he does in fact have Lyme disease. I explained that Lyme disease can cause problems with other organs if not treated appropriately. We discussed that sometimes antibiotics need to be administered intravenously if oral antibiotics are not given early enough. We will see how he does with a course of oral antibiotics as I would like to avoid intravenous antibiotics.
- Medical Treatment: Prescription for doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 3 weeks provided. Lyme titer and Western blot will be obtained to determine if he has Lyme disease.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This is well-controlled at this time.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed that he is doing really well monitoring his blood pressure at home.
- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg once a day. Lipid panel ordered to assess his cholesterol levels.

3. Diabetes type 2.
- Medical Reasoning: He is doing a good job managing his diabetes since his blood sugars are running in the 120s. I do not think we need to make any adjustments, but we will see what the hemoglobin A1c shows as that gives us an idea of what his blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that metformin can affect kidney function; however, his kidney function was last checked 2 months ago, and it has remained within normal limits.
- Medical Treatment: Continue metformin 1000 mg twice a day. Hemoglobin A1c ordered. Basic metabolic panel ordered to assess kidney function.

"[doctor] . next patient is michelle king . date of birth : 05/07/1982 . please use toc template . she was admitted to district regional hospital on 06/29/2021 , and was discharged on 07/02/2021 . the patient is a 39-year-old female with history of quadriplegia due to , uh , prior spinal cord injury . she was experiencing increasing concerns for spasms and lightheadedness , significant constipation , and reported diaphoresis . she was evaluated in the emergency department where she was , uh , febrile and had significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000 . there were concerns for ongoing urinary tract infection , but she was treated with iv antibiotic therapy . she had labile blood pressure , headache , and vomiting . in the end , she slowly improved . she does have a supra-pubic catheter . cultures were obtained and reviewed . she was eventually discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms . she presents today to follow up regarding these concerns . hi , michelle . how are you doing ?
[patient] not too bad . and yourself ?
[doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ?
[patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i told them when i went to the er ... is that your phone ?
[doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on .
[patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , "" no , "" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .
[doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high .
[patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?
[doctor] typically , it does n't .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive .
[patient] yeah , that's what they said .
[doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ...
[patient] hm .
[doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] uh , they did n't do a cat scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ?
[patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .
[doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in .
[patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .
[doctor] well , maybe that's all it was .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ?
[patient] yes , i am .
[doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] great . so here are my thoughts .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ?
[patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .
[doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ?
[patient] sure , i can do that .
[doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see .
[patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .
[doctor] yeah .
[patient] when i do n't go , i double up on that .
[doctor] have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing .
[patient] is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?
[doctor] yes .
[patient] then , yes . i have it . it takes about two days to work and then it's a brutal two days .
[doctor] got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right . so we have our plan . any questions ?
[patient] yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid , if we can .
[doctor] sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ?
[patient] i am unvaccinated .
[doctor] so what are your concerns about the vaccine ?
[patient] well , we do n't know the side effects .
[doctor] correct , we do n't .
[patient] it's too soon to tell the side effects , and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as "" vaccine injury "" .
[doctor] right .
[patient] which i had never heard of before . i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to beat it , even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c.
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i also take multivitamins and i'm closely monitored . so i guess i do n't feel as though i really the vaccine .
[doctor] well , my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid it's not going to be good for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i think it's safe . i mean , i understand and hear you . all of these stories out there about this , uh , regarding the vaccine . but i've seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice , and i do n't disagree that if you got covid you'd probably be okay .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i have had healthy people die from covid .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i've had some people get really , really sick from it . so personally , i believe that this vaccine is completely safe . i really think that .
[patient] all of them ?
[doctor] yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines , so you have to go back and think about it . do you get flu shot every year ?
[patient] no , i do n't .
[doctor] right , well , it's hard for me to convince you because you're making a consistent viewpoint .
[patient] well , i am open-minded to this .
[doctor] mm-hmm . to me , it's , you know , a lot of the stuff out there is fear and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine . we've seen what the virus can do . i also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so i'm not concerned about the side effects of this . i do n't think it does anything . um , and we have vaccinated 50 % of the country .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] the er is full of these vaccines .
[patient] i understand .
[doctor] so there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine . i mean , there's guillain-barre , and all these things that could happen from the vaccine , but they're just very rare . my thing for you is i'm not convinced that there's alternative stuff or even the treatment we have , like the monoclonal antibodies , that will give help , but it's just my opinion .
[patient] well , that's what i'm here for .
[doctor] yeah . right now the numbers are low . even with the delta variant , when it starts mutating , it's actually good because it becomes more contagious , but less deadly .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so that's what's gon na happen with covid . that's what's mo- most of the science supports and this is how most pandemics end , is that the virus starts losing its potency .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] but think about it , and if you have any more questions you can certainly let me know , okay ?
[patient] will do .
[doctor] all right . anything else we can discuss today ?
[patient] nope . i think i'm all set . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . so we'll see you in two to three weeks . have a good rest of your day .
[patient] thanks , you too .
[doctor] next line heading will be "" acute to chronic constipation "" . she believes her hospitalization was more likely due to her dysreflexia , from her quadriplegia that typically occurs . she did have a lot of vital signs changes , including blood pressure fluctuations . the patient feels like she has a good bowel regimen , including taking the miralax regularly as a primary treatment for constipation issues as well as lactulose for severe constipation . she feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection and was just related to her constipation . however , we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis .
[doctor] i would recommend just in the next three or four weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs , and we'll repeat the cbc just to make sure her white blood cells tend downward . uh , next line and heading will be "" quadriplegia "" . um , next line and heading will be "" covid vaccine status "" . again , she's hesitant . we had a good discussion , and i recommended that the only true preventative mechanism for covid is the vaccine . i do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off . i would be concerned if she does n't get the vaccine and i would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status . she does not want to get covid . however , she needs to make these decisions . she is somewhat homeopathic .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Transition of care visit.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Michelle King is a 39-year-old female who presents for a transition care visit. She was admitted to District Regional Hospital on 06/29/2021 and discharged on 07/02/2021.

The patient has a history quadriplegia from a prior spinal cord injury. She reported an increased concern for spasms, lightheadedness, headaches, significant constipation, and diaphoresis. Due to her uncontrolled blood pressure, headaches, and vomiting, she was evaluated in the emergency department. She was noted to be febrile, had a significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000, and labile blood pressure. Cultures were obtained and reviewed, with a urinary tract infection suspected. To note, the patient does require use of a suprapubic catheter. She was provided IV antibiotic therapy and was discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms.

Today, the patient states she is feeling good and claims that she does not think she had an infection. Instead, she believes she was just constipated and that was the cause of her elevated blood pressure. She states she did not have a bowel movement in the hospital and when she got home, she had a large bowel movement and felt better. She states that she told the medical team in the emergency room that she was constipated, but they did not feel that was the causative agent, although they did complete x-rays and additional tests. The patient reports taking MiraLAX consistently for her constipation and Lactulose as needed, which takes 2 days produce a bowel movement.

The patient has not received the COVID-19 vaccinations because she does not know the side effects. She reports taking vitamin C and a multivitamin and she does not feel the need for the vaccine even though her “respiratory status is limited”. The patient also denies receiving the flu vaccine.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Quadriplegia.
Spinal cord injury.
Hypertension.
Chronic constipation.
Automatic dysreflexia.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

MiraLAX as needed by mouth.
Lactulose as needed by mouth.

ASSESSMENT

• Acute to chronic constipation.
• Quadriplegia.

PLAN

Acute to chronic constipation
She believes that her hospitalization was more likely due to her constipation and dysreflexia from her quadriplegia. She had a lot of vital sign changes including blood pressure fluctuations. She feels like she has got a good bowel regimen. She does take MiraLAX consistently, and Lactulose for severe constipation. She feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection. However, we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis. I would recommend in the next 3 or 4 weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs and we will repeat the CBC and ensure that trends downwards.

COVID vaccine status
Again, she is hesitant. We had a good discussion. I recommend that the only real, true preventative mechanism for COVID is the vaccine. I do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off. I would be concerned that she does not get vaccinated, I would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status. She does not want to get COVID. However, she needs to make these decisions. She is somewhat homeopathic in some of her viewpoints.

[doctor] it is, yeah. it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation. it's pretty good stuff. um, tell me what's going on.
[patient] it is, in my humble opinion, that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high. and i hardly pooped when i was there. then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better. i told them that when i was admitted, and they did x-rays and everything, but they said, "" no, "" as they didn't think that wasn't... that was it. but you know, i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped.

Right ankle injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jerry Cook is a 45-year-old male who presents today with a right ankle injury.

The patient sustained an injury to the right ankle while playing basketball with his son. He reports he landed awkwardly and twisted his right ankle after jumping to make a layup. His pain is primarily located along the lateral aspect of the right ankle. He notes bruising and swelling. The patient is able to weight-bear while standing. He experiences pain and feelings of instability within the ankle while ambulating and is concerned for further injury.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient works from home and plans to coach his son’s basketball team in 04/2022. He enjoys working out and reports he recently resumed engaging in a consistent gym routine.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right ankle pain and instability.
Skin: Reports right ankle bruising and swelling.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Brisk capillary refill.
SKIN: No epidermolysis. Intact.
MSK: Examination of the right ankle: Exquisite tenderness laterally. Mild tenderness over the medial deltoid region. Swelling on the lateral side of the ankle. No horrible malalignment.

RESULTS

X-rays, including AP, lateral, and oblique views of the right ankle, were obtained in the office and reviewed today. These demonstrate a displaced lateral malleolus at the Weber C level. There is no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures.

ASSESSMENT

Right lateral malleolar fracture.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding treatment options. Recommendation was made for an open reduction internal fixation of the right ankle. We discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure as well as the postoperative recovery period following surgery. I advised that it will be 3 months before he can resume his exercise routine. In the meantime, I will prescribe meloxicam to reduce swelling. I recommended he ice and elevate the ankle as well. He will be given crutches to assist with ambulation.

[patient] okay
[doctor] so i also see you're here for you have a past medical history of of hypertension and when you came in today your blood pressure was a little bit high it was a one fifty over ninety i'm reading here in your chart you're on two point five of norvasc

[patient] okay
[doctor] that's that's that's not too bad i think when you first came in you were around like one eighty so it seems to be that that norvasc is is working for you how about your diet i know you were having a little issue eating some fast food and and cakes and cookies and have you been able to get that under control
[patient] yeah it's hard to give up the fast food altogether because it's a lot of on the go you know
[doctor] okay so do you think you would be able to get that under control by yourself or would you do you think you would need help with that maybe a dietitian be able to help you out
[patient] yeah i do n't know i do n't know if i can make another appointment i just add to the extra
[doctor] okay
[patient] less time to make food so
[doctor] yeah yeah definitely understand

[doctor] alright yeah so i mean that's one thing we just got ta work one is your diet we try to keep you at least just twenty three hundred milligrams or less of sodium per day i know that's hard for a lot of salads and stuff i know it's hard for lot of people especially with all like the the prepackage foods we have around today so that's definitely something we we should work on
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] so let's also look here you have a history of diabetes and so you're on that five hundred milligrams of metformin daily now have you been taking that as well
[patient] yeah i take my metformin
[doctor] okay

[doctor] okay
[patient] but i think they've been pretty good
[doctor] okay so i'm looking here i think last after your last visit you got a1c now was six . seven so it's a little bit high it's gone down a little bit since you were first diagnosed with the type two diabetes a year ago so i'm glad we're making progress with that as well alright so i'm just gon na do a quick physical exam on you before i do just wan na make sure are you having any chest pain today
[patient] no
[doctor] alright any any belly pain
[patient] no
[doctor] alright so i'm gon na listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles listen to your heart so on your heart exam i do hear that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and we already knew about that previously so it has n't gotten any worse so that's good so i'm gon na just press here in your abdomen because that you did have those kidney stones does that hurt

[patient] okay
[doctor] alright we'll get a urine culture just to make sure everything is is cleared up i also want to give you a referral to referral referral to urology

Right elbow pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Lawrence Butler is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right elbow pain.

Over the past week, the patient has developed 6/10 pain in the ""inside"" of his right elbow. The pain may radiate into his forearm on occasion, but does not extend up to his shoulder. He denies any history of trauma or injury, but he did start making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic and suspects that his symptoms could be related to that. His symptoms affect his ability to lift objects or perform his typical activities of daily living. Ibuprofen provides minimal symptomatic relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that he began making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that he has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right elbow pain.

VITALS

Normal

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right elbow: Moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle. No pain with supination of the forearm. Pain with pronation of the forearm. Pain with resistance against flexion of the wrist.

RESULTS

X-ray imaging of the right elbow was obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

Right medial epicondylitis.

PLAN

The patient and I discussed his diagnosis in detail, and I explained that his symptoms are likely caused by overuse and potential damage of the tendons. We will provide him with sling to be worn during the day while he is awake. I want him to take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours with food for a full week and ice the elbow for 20 minutes, 3 times daily. Finally, I advised the patient to rest his elbow and avoid doing any pottery for the next couple of weeks.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 1 week.","Generate a concise medical summary focusing on key findings and treatment plans. Include chief complaints, symptoms, medications, and recommendations if mentioned in the conversation:[doctor] hey lawrence how're you doing

"[doctor] hey betty how are you doing
[patient] i'm doing okay i just been really frustrated because with my asthma and it just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms
[patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since
[doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems
[patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department
[doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now
[patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work
[doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or
[patient] yes yes that's the name of it
[doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that
[patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well
[doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help
[patient] it does
[doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs
[patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs
[doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep
[patient] yeah for the most part
[doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er
[patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then
[doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those
[patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone
[doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing
[patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days
[doctor] okay
[patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days
[doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation
[patient] probably about a month ago
[doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that
[patient] no not really
[doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center
[patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again
[doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis
[patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana
[doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all
[patient] hmmm hmmm
[doctor] okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that
[patient] sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me
[doctor] okay
[patient] so i do n't try to go there often
[doctor] okay thank you for sharing that with me so if it's okay with you i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam
[patient] okay
[doctor] now i reviewed your vitals for today and your your blood pressure is good it's one twenty eight over eighty two your respiratory rate is sixteen and your oxygen saturation is ninety nine percent on room air which is a good thing i'm gon na take a listen to your heart here your heart is regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any ectopic beats or and i do n't hear anything like rubs murmurs or gallops which is good so i'm gon na go take and listen to your lungs here on your lung exam i do appreciate some diminished lung sounds throughout with the occasional slight expiratory wheeze and that's bilaterally so i hear that on both sides i'm gon na go do a quick neck exam here neck is supple trachea is midline i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy taking a listen here i do n't appreciate any carotid bruit now i'm also gon na take a look at your hands here i note strong bilateral pulses i do n't appreciate any clubbing on any of your fingertips which is which is important and i also note brisk capillary refill i'm gon na go ahead and review the results of your pulmonary function test that i had you do when you came into the office today and reviewing those results i do see that they are consistent with somebody who would be diagnosed with asthma so lem me go ahead and tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so now for your first problem of asthma your symptoms are consistent with moderate to intermediate or i'm sorry moderate moderate intermittent asthma and it's gon na be really important for us to be consistent with your inhaled inhaled steroid inhaler so i'm gon na need you to take that as prescribed and that's really gon na help cut down on those daily symptoms and needing to use that rescue inhaler that albuterol inhaler as frequently so the more you take and more consistently you take your inhaled steroid inhaler the less you will use your albuterol now it's not a fast acting inhaler like your albuterol but what is important is as going to be what helps you long term now if you do have an acute exacerbation so if you're having an acute issue with your breathing i do want you to continue to use your albuterol inhaler one to two puffs and then i want you to wait and see how your breathing is before you would take an additional one to two puffs we hope you have less of those acute exacerbations as you continue to use your inhaled steroid i'm also going to put together an asthma action plan for you and that's gon na help us look at your symptoms see where your your pain points can be you know like those being having issues with with cats or dust that type of thing and we'll work on how to handle those symptoms through that asthma action plan so do you have any questions comments or concerns otherwise i will see you in thirty days

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Moderate intermittent asthma.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's symptoms and results of her PFT are consistent with moderate intermittent asthma.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the importance of consistency with her daily inhaler as this will help prevent daily symptoms and the need to use the albuterol inhaler as frequently. My hope is that she has less acute exacerbations as she continues to use her inhaled steroid.
- Medical Treatment: Prescribed provided for Flovent 110 mcg 1 puff twice per day. She can continue using her Ventolin inhaler 2 puffs every 4 to 6 hours as needed. I have recommended using her albuterol inhaler 1 to 2 puffs and then monitor her breathing prior to taking an additional 1 to 2 puffs. I am also going to put together an asthma action plan for her so we know what to do based on her symptoms.

Her blood pressure is typically normal, however will become elevated approximately one week a month. She notes it is typically elevated because she is traveling a lot that week for work. While traveling, she is not eating as well and does not monitor her blood pressure. The patient is taking her lisinopril as prescribed.

Regarding her depression, she states she is doing well. Last year she started therapy and she has been going once a week, which has helped. Her support system is great and includes her boyfriend, mom, and brother.
