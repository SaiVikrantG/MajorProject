She has tried over-the-counter treatments such as Head & Shoulders and castor oil, but they have not been effective. There are no associated rashes elsewhere on her body, and she denies any recent changes in hair products or dying her hair. No significant joint pain, fever, or weight loss has been reported. Her sister also experiences dry scalp issues, though less severe than Barbara's.\n\nVITALS\nBlood pressure: 130/68 mmHg\nHeart rate: 98 bpm\nRespiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute\nTemperature: 97.7°F\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\nBarbara's scalp shows demarcated scaly erythematous plaques, particularly on the back of her skull, leading to widespread dandruff and itching. No other abnormalities noted during the examination.\n\nRESULTS\nNo specific lab results or imaging studies mentioned.\n\nASSESSMENT\nBarbara is diagnosed with scalp psoriasis, characterized by the presence of scaly, red patches on her scalp.\n\nPLAN\nTreatment plan includes:\n- Topical application of clobetasol 0.05% solution twice daily on affected areas\n- Continued use of T-Gel shampoo\n- Use of steroids for flare-ups as needed\n- Follow-up appointment in three months or sooner if symptoms worsen\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nBarbara is instructed to apply the clobetasol solution twice daily during flare-ups and maintain regular use of T-Gel shampoo. She should contact the doctor if symptoms escalate or if she requires earlier follow-up.",

She has had high blood pressure for a long time and was prescribed Chlorthalidone by her provider, but she doesn't take it due to stomach discomfort. The headaches have been intermittent for about a month, accompanied by occasional dizziness, blurred vision, chest pain, and shortness of breath.

Presence of a persistent systolic ejection murmur and bilateral leg edema.\n\nPLAN\nContinue current medication regimen, encourage consistent daily intake of Chlorthalidone and Metformin, and set reminders. Monitor blood pressure three times weekly at home using a recommended device. Schedule a follow-up in one month to reassess blood pressure control. Refer to a nutritionist for dietary consultation to reduce sodium intake and manage blood pressure and blood sugar levels. Increase Metformin dosage to 1500 mg.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nTake Chlorthalidone and Metformin as prescribed, set reminders for medication intake, and monitor blood pressure at home. Follow up in one month for reassessment. Consult a nutritionist for dietary advice. Avoid excessive consumption of high-sodium foods like McDonald's. Check blood sugar levels regularly and report any significant changes.",

    "system_output": "\n    CONVERSATION:\n    [doctor] okay , so our next patient is christopher watson . date of birth 04/12/1934 . mr . watson is- is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow-up for adult hydrocephalus . this is his first visit since undergoing sh- shunt surgery , excuse me , on august 1st , 2020 .\r\n[doctor] i have followed mr . watson since may of 2020 when he first presented with eight to ten years of progressive gait impairment , cognitive impairment , and decreased bladder control . we established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with a spino catheter protocol in june 2020 , and he underwent shunt surgery on august 1st , 2020 . a medtronic strata programmable shunt in the ventricular peritoneal configuration was programmed at a level 2.0 was placed .\r\n[doctor] good morning , mr . watson , who is the nice lady you have with you today ?\r\n[patient] hi , doc . this is my daughter , theresa . she is the one who helps me keep things straight .\r\n[doctor] mr . watson , have you been sick or been hosp -- hospitalized since your shu- shunt surgery three months ago .\r\n[patient] uh , not that i recall .\r\n[patient_guest] no , he has n't . he has been doing much better .\r\n[doctor] good , i'm glad to hear that .\r\n[doctor] before surgery , you were having some progressive problems that affected your walking , thinking , and bladder control . are these symptoms better , worse , or unchanged ?\r\n[patient_guest] his walking has improved . he's now able to walk to the dining room just fine . but he could not do that before surgery . he still has times where i have to help him .\r\n[doctor] that's impressive , mr . watson .\r\n[patient] yeah , i guess .\r\n[patient_guest] now his bladder control did improve some after surgery , but now seems to have leveled out . so he is wearing diapers .\r\n[doctor] no issues with sores from wearing the diaper ? and any decreased or painful urination ?\r\n[patient_guest] no , not at all .\r\n[doctor] and how about cognition ?\r\n[patient] i think i'm better . i do n't feel lost when talking to someone anymore .\r\n[patient_guest] dad and i both think my sister , hannah , summarized it best . she said \" i feel like i can have a normal conversation with him again , \"\r\n[doctor] that's so wonderful ! now have you had any headaches or pain where the shunt is ?\r\n[patient] no . has n't bothered me one bit .\r\n[doctor] okay . and any pain in your belly at all ?\r\n[patient] ca n't say that i have .\r\n[doctor] okay , sounds like you have been improving . alrighty , mr . watson , i'm going to step out of the room while my resident comes in to do a few tests for me . is that all right ?\r\n[patient] sounds good .\r\n[doctor] okay , i'm going to go out and review the ct scan you had last month , and then we'll chat about it when i come in .\r\n[doctor] all righty , mr . watson , so you definitely have made some improvements since the shunt surgery . now on ct scan though i do believe i see a tiny bit of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region . now , i do n't believe that that's causing any symptoms , and i , it actually was n't documented by the radiologist when he read the ct scan .\r\n[patient] so what does that mean ?\r\n[doctor] just that i would like to leave the shunt set for another two to three months before we go in changing it . like i said , if you're not having any headaches or pain and you have improved so that's all good for me . so really there's , there's nothing to worry about .\r\n[patient] all right so i'll come back in three months ?\r\n[doctor] yep , that's right .\r\n[patient] i do have a question for you though .\r\n[doctor] yeah , of course .\r\n[patient] do you think i will be able to drive again ?\r\n[doctor] ah man , mr . watson , i knew you were gon na ask me that one . i think at this point it's unlikely that your movement speed will improve to the level that would be needed for you to pass the driver safety evaluation . now , i will say that i do occasionally have patients who surprise me by improving over a nine to 12 month range . and that , that definitely could be you . you could definitely pass it at that point . so if you improve and we can continue to talk about that then , ya know , i think it could be possible , um , and i'd be happy to recommend it .\r\n[doctor] now , you could definitely also enroll in a driver safety program without my recommendation . so you could kind of do that preemptively , and then we could continue to watch for your improvement as we go .\r\n[patient] okay . i kinda figured that anyway but i just thought i'd ask . i do n't like to burden anyone when i just need to run to the store but i also know that i need to be safe .\r\n[doctor] yeah , your safety is our number one priority and , ya know , i'm sure your daughters do n't mind as much , right , they want to keep you here and have you safe . but , i overall am very pleased with how much you have improved . and so , i'm sure when we talk again in three months , we'll continue to be on that upward trajectory or improvement .\r\n[patient] i sure hope so , doc .\r\n[patient_guest] we really appreciate all that you've done . do we make the appointment out front ?\r\n[doctor] yeah , that would be great . the girls up front will take care of you and get you settled for three months from now , and you both take care , all right ?\r\n[patient] thanks\r\n[patient_guest] thank you .\r\n[doctor] all righty , so ros is constitutional significant for impaired

Only include sections for which there is sufficient information available.\n     CHIEF COMPLAINT\n    Mr. Watson presents for a follow-up visit three months post-shunt surgery for adult hydrocephalus, reporting improved walking but persistent urinary incontinence and cognitive impairment. He denies any recent hospitalizations, headaches, or abdominal pain.\n\n    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n    Mr. Watson, an 86-year-old male, has been experiencing progressive gait impairment, cognitive decline, and decreased bladder control for approximately eight to ten years. He was diagnosed with adult hydrocephalus and initially managed with a spinal catheter protocol in June 2020. Shunt surgery was performed on August 1st, 2020, using a Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in a ventricular-peritoneal configuration, set at level 2.0. Post-surgery, Mr. Watson reported improved walking ability, particularly reaching the dining room, although assistance is still required. Bladder control showed initial improvement but has since plateaued, necessitating diaper use. Cognitive function has shown modest improvement, with less confusion during conversations. No symptoms of shunt malfunction such as headaches or abdominal pain were reported.\n\n    VITALS\n    Blood pressure: 124/80 mmHg\n    Heart rate: 64 bpm\n    Respiratory rate: 18 breaths/min\n    Weight: 174 lbs\n    Pain: 0/10\n\n    PHYSICAL EXAM\n    General appearance: Pleasant and cooperative, able to converse easily with assistance from his daughter.\n    Shunt site: Clean, dry, and intact with confirmed setting of 2.\n    Neurological: MMSE scores improved from 23/30 to 26/30 for calculations and from 24/30 to 26/30 for spelling. Memory recall improved from none with cueing to two words with cueing and one with multiple-choice. Tinetti assessment: Gait score 6-8/12, balance score 12/16, total score 18-20/28 (improved from 15-17/28).\n    Cranial nerves: Pupils equal, EOMs intact, face symmetric, no dysarthria.\n    Motor: Normal for bulk and strength, coordination slow from finger-to-nose test.\n    CT scan findings: Frontal horn span at foramen of Monro 4.6 cm, flat third ventricular contour 10 mm, tiny blood/fluid collection in right frontal region, substantial small vessel ischemic changes.\n\n    RESULTS\n    CT scan: Shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Monro of 4.6 cm with a flat third ventricular contour of 10 mm. Noted a tiny amount of blood/fluid collection in the right frontal region and substantial small vessel ischemic changes. Initial MMSE scores were 23/30 for calculations and 24/30 for spelling; improved to 26/30 for both. Initial Tinetti score was 15-17/28, improved to 18-20/28.\n\n    ASSESSMENT\n    Adult hydrocephalus, post-shunt surgery, with ongoing gait impairment, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment. Improvement noted in walking ability and cognitive function, but urinary incontinence remains an issue.\n\n    PLAN\n    Continue monitoring with the current shunt settings for another two to three months due to minor findings on CT scan. No immediate intervention indicated unless symptoms worsen. Consider driving evaluation in the future if significant improvement occurs. Schedule follow-up in three months. Educate patient and family on signs of shunt malfunction and encourage adherence to follow-up appointments.\n\n    INSTRUCTIONS\n    Patient and family advised to monitor for any new or worsening symptoms such as headaches, abdominal pain, or changes in mental status. Instructed to maintain regular follow-up appointments and adhere to the recommended shunt settings. Encouraged to discuss driving concerns with the healthcare team in the future if improvement is observed.",

    "reference": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\r\n\r\nFollow up adult hydrocephalus, 3 months status post shunt surgery.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\r\n\r\nMr. Christopher Watson is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow up of adult hydrocephalus. This is his first visit since undergoing shunt surgery 08/01/2020. He is accompanied by his daughter, Theresa, together they give his history.\r\n\r\nI have followed Mr. Watson since May 2020. He presented with 8-10 years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control. We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with the spinal catheter protocol in June 2020 and he underwent shunt surgery on 08/01/2020. A Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration programmed at level 2.0 was placed.\r\n\r\nMr. Watson has had no hospitalizations or other illnesses since I last saw him. With respect to his walking, his daughter states that he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine but could not before his surgery. His balance has improved though he still has some walking impairment. With respect to his bladder control, initially there was some improvement, but he has leveled off and he wears a diaper. With respect to his cognition, both Theresa and the patient say that his thinking has improved. The other daughter, Hannah summarized it best according to the two of them, she said “I feel like I can have a normal conversation with him again.” Mr. Watson has had no headaches and no pain at the shunt site or in the abdomen.\r\n\r\nPAST HISTORY\r\n\r\nUrinary incontinence.\r\nAdult hydrocephalus.\r\nGait impairment.\r\nCognitive impairment.\r\n\r\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\r\n\r\n• Constitutional Symptoms: Significant for impaired ability to carry out daily functions. Negative for fever or unintentional weight loss.\r\n• Genitourinary: Significant for urinary incontinence and wearing a diaper. Negative for genital sores, decreased or painful output.\r\n• Neurological: Significant for continued walking impairment and cognitive impairment. Negative for headaches, recent falls, or hallucinations.\r\n• Psychiatric: Negative for depression, excessive worrying, or mood swings.\r\n\r\nVITALS\r\n\r\nBlood pressure 124/80, heart rate is 64, respiratory rate is 18, weight 174 pounds, and pain is 0/10.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL EXAM\r\n\r\nConstitutional\r\nMr. Watson is a pleasant and cooperative man who is able to converse easily though his daughter adds some details.\r\n\r\nHead and Face\r\nThe shunt site was clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 2.0.\r\n\r\nNeurological\r\nMental status: Tested for recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, and fund of knowledge. He scored 26/30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25/30 when tested with calculations. Of note, he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing and the third one with multiple choice. This was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23/30 with calculations and 24/30 with spelling and at that time he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing and only one with multiple choice.\r\nGait: Tested using the Tinetti assessment tool. He was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of 6-8/12 and a balance of score of 12/16 for a total score of 18-20/28. This has slightly improved from his initial score of 15-17/28.\r\nCranial Nerves: Pupils are equal. Extraocular movements are intact. Face symmetric. No dysarthria.\r\nMotor: Normal for bulk and strength.\r\nCoordination: Slow for finger-to-nose.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nCT scan of the head from 10/15/2020: It shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 4.6 cm with a 3rd ventricular contour that is flat with the span of 10 mm. By my reading, there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with just a tiny subdural collection. This was not noticed by the radiologist who stated no extra axial fluid collections. There is also substantial small vessel ischemic change.\r\n\r\nASSESSMENT\r\n\r\n• Adult hydrocephalus.\r\n• Gait impairment.\r\n• Urinary incontinence and urgency.\r\n• Cognitive impairment.\r\n\r\nMr. Watson has made some improvement with his hydrocephalus since shunt surgery. There is a tiny fluid collection in the right parietal region. I do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptomatic, and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan.\r\n\r\nMr. Watson asked me about whether he will be able to drive again. Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a driver's safety evaluation, however, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test. I would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if I believe he is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, however, I think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time. I also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test.\r\n\r\nPLAN\r\n\r\nI had a long discussion with the patient and his daughter. We are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because of the fluid collection in the right parietal region, I would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nFollow up in 3 months."

also i can get it when i'm really stressed but recently and why i went to her is because my headaches have been getting a lot more they've just been happening a lot more frequently and a lot more severe\r\n[patient] okay can you tell me a little bit about them what how do they how do they feel when they come on\r\n[doctor] so they say mostly on my right side and it even seems like it's like behind my eye and it just like this pulsing like this really bad pulsing sensation\r\n[patient] okay do you notice these any activities or time of the day that makes them worse i know you said they they seem to get worse around your menstrual periods but is there any time of the day or that makes them worse\r\n[doctor] i i have noticed that you know i've been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight but i ca n't even really exercise for very long because i start of as soon as i start to jog i my headaches the headaches come back on a lot worse so i notice it when i'm exercising\r\n[patient] okay and do you seem to have any other symptoms when you get these headaches i've been having a ringing in my ears for a few months now and then what really scared me is that now i'm starting to get some blurred vision it's not all the time but it it will come and go but some blurred like on the\r\n[doctor] in my on the side of my vision\r\n[patient] okay okay and have you experienced any numbness or tingling to your hands or feet or your face\r\n[doctor] no i have n't\r\n[patient] okay so you you like to run a lot what kind of do you do you use a a good shoe you know what kind of shoes do you use for your running\r\n[doctor] yeah i yeah i i'm starting to get back into it i'm a big new balance person in asics so yeah those are the two brands i like to wear yeah so right now i'm using asics\r\n[patient] okay yeah i like to run too and i use nike\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] i used to get tumor guy but i i really kinda moved over to nike\r\n[doctor] hmmm\r\n[patient] that's good you know it is running is a great exercise\r\n[doctor] it is\r\n[patient] so have you had any let's get back to the exam here have you had a recent mri of your brain i saw one from a few years ago but as doctor white said anything about getting a more a recent mri\r\n[doctor] yeah she was gon na put one in but she wanted me to see you first and urgently so they have n't called me yet for the mri\r\n[patient] okay so that's good we i think we'll we will follow up with that mri but let's go ahead and take a do a quick physical exam here i reviewed your vitals that the the assistant collected when you came in and everything there looks good including your blood pressure you know with symptoms like that that's one of those things that i'd be concerned about\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] now on your heart exam it sounds like it's normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs rubs or gallops so that's good as i listen i'm gon na go ahead and look here in your eyes the funduscopic exam shows papilledema and that's just some of swelling behind there in the eye and this let me do a a neurological exam this will take a few minutes you get up to follow my instructions as we go through that okay on neurological exam your cranial nerves one through twelve are intact including a normal cranial reflex and just went to watch you walk across the room here\r\n[doctor] okay turn around come back and okay so on musculoskeletal exam your gait is normal\r\n[doctor] okay go ahead sorry\r\n[patient] that's okay for your first problem your headaches your symptoms are concerning for what we call idiopathic intracranial hypertension and this is a condition that that you have increased pressure in the in your head in your brain without any known cause for it now patient also presents with often present with symptoms such as yours you know headaches worsening with activity ringing in the ears changes in your vision so i'm i'm pretty confident that that's what we're having here now why we get concerned is if the pressure continues to increase this can lead to some permanent changes in your vision so i i do wan na get a a few more tests just so we can confirm that diagnosis and the first one that we just talked about is an mri i think it's really important to get that to check for any other condition that could be contributing to your symptoms now once i have that result i'm gon na be doing also doing a spinal tap which will help me evaluate the pressure in the brain and it can also help you feel better if you do have an increased pressure by taking the decreasing the amount of that pressure just by taking a a a little bit of fluid off of that and lastly i want you to be seen by a neuro-ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam now i i know that sounds like a lot of information but i think it's really important we get that accomplished do you have any questions for me\r\n[doctor] yeah that is a lot and so i i'm sure i'll have more that comes up but so let's say we do all this test and it confirms what you're saying does that mean was i referred to you because that means i will need surgery\r\n[patient] not necessarily if you have idiopathic intracranial hypertension there are number of medications that we can try to help decrease that pressure in your brain and this will also help you have less headaches when you exercise as exercise and weight loss are also an important part of the treatment\r\n[doctor] okay alright alright and i'll probably add something about so is this something i'll be doing soon is this all things i'll be doing this week\r\n[patient] yeah that's a great question here i i'm gon na go ahead and we're gon na for the mri i'll have to get a preapproval from your insurance company i will work on that my my my team in the front office will get that preapproved and then once that's done we'll call you to help schedule that mri\r\n[doctor] okay alright thank you bye\r\n[patient] bye sorry\n\n    SUMMARY:\n    Please generate a medical summary based on the following clinical notes. The summary should include the following sections: Chief Complaint, History of Present Illness, Vitals, Physical Exam, Results, Assessment, Plan, and Instructions.\n    Please format the response as plain text, without using markdown or special formatting, and with clear headings for each section, like this:\n\n\n    CHIEF COMPLAINT\n    A concise statement of the patient's primary concern or reason for visiting the clinic.\n\n    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n    A detailed narrative about the patient's symptoms, their onset, duration, and any relevant medical history or previous treatments.\n\n    VITALS\n    Include any relevant vital signs (e.g., oxygen saturation, blood pressure) if available.\n\n    PHYSICAL EXAM \n    Summarize the findings from the physical examination, including any notable abnormalities.\n\n    RESULTS \n    Summarize the results of any diagnostic tests performed (e.g., lab work, imaging studies).\n\n    ASSESSMENT\n    The doctor's assessment of the patient's condition or diagnosis.\n\n    PLAN\n    The treatment plan, including prescribed medications, lifestyle recommendations, and follow-up instructions.\n\n    INSTRUCTIONS\n    Specific instructions for the patient regarding their treatment plan and follow-up care.\n\n    Important Note: If any section lacks relevant information or if specific details are not provided (e.g., vitals are not mentioned, no abnormal findings in the physical exam), omit that section from the generated summary. Only include sections for which there is sufficient information available.\n     CHIEF COMPLAINT\nHeadaches\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\nThe patient, a female, reports a long-standing history of headaches, dating back to her teenage years. Initially, the headaches were associated with her menstrual cycles, but as she aged, they became more frequent and severe. Recently, the headaches have intensified, prompting her visit to the clinic. She describes the headaches as pulsating, primarily located on the right side, and sometimes extending behind her eye. They worsen with physical activity, particularly jogging, and she experiences visual disturbances, including blurred vision and tinnitus. No numbness or tingling in her extremities or face has been reported.\n\nVITALS\nNo vital signs provided.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\nThe patient's heart exam revealed a normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Funduscopic examination showed papilledema, indicating increased intracranial pressure. Neurological examination was otherwise unremarkable, with intact cranial nerves and normal gait.\n\nRESULTS\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain is pending, with a pre-authorization request submitted to the patient's insurance. A lumbar puncture is planned to assess cerebrospinal fluid pressure and rule out other causes of increased intracranial pressure. Referral to a neuro-ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye examination is also scheduled.\n\nASSESSMENT\nThe patient's symptoms and findings suggest idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), characterized by increased intracranial pressure without a known cause. This condition is associated with headaches, visual disturbances, and tinnitus, which align with the patient's presentation. Papilledema further supports this diagnosis.\n\nPLAN\nThe management plan includes:\n1. Confirming the diagnosis of IIH through MRI and lumbar puncture.\n2. Initiating medical therapy to reduce intracranial pressure, potentially including carbonic anhydrase inhibitors or acetazolamide.\n3. Encouraging weight loss and regular exercise, especially low-impact activities.\n4. Close monitoring of visual acuity and headache frequency.\n5. Referral to a neuro-ophthalmologist for a thorough eye examination.\n6. Coordination with the patient's primary care physician for ongoing management.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nThe patient is advised to avoid strenuous activities until further evaluation and to maintain a healthy diet for weight management. She should report any worsening of symptoms or new visual disturbances immediately. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled after the completion of diagnostic tests and receipt of results.

The patient was referred from her primary care physician. The patient states that she was seen by Dr. White a few years ago and was going to obtain an MRI; however, Dr. White wanted her to see me first and urgently.\r\n\r\nThe onset of her headaches began when she was a teenager. Initially, her headaches appeared during menses, however she now experiences them more frequently and with more severity. Her pain is aggravated by physical activities. The patient states that she has been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight, however she is unable to exercise for prolonged periods of time secondary to the headaches. The patient locates her pain to the right side of her head and behind her eye. She describes her pain as a pulsing sensation. She also reports intermittent ringing in her ears for the last few months. Additionally, she reports intermittent blurred vision on the lateral aspect of her vision. She denies any numbness or tingling in her hands, feet, or face.\r\n\r\nThe patient enjoys running and wears either New Balance or Asics shoes.\r\n\r\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\r\n\r\nNeurological: Reports headaches.

I have recommended that we obtain an urgent MRI of the brain to evaluate for any other condition that could be contributing to her symptoms. We will contact her to schedule this after approved by insurance. Once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion, I will also perform a spinal tap to evaluate the pressure in the brain. I have also advised her to be seen by a neuro ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam. Questions were invited and answered today. The patient agrees to the treatment plan.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nThe patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further recommendations."

    "system_output": "\n    CONVERSATION:\n    [doctor] okay . next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12/27/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female , uh , who was previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . hi . good afternoon , ashley . how are you doing ?\r\n[patient] i'm doing okay . how are you .\r\n[doctor] i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad .\r\n[patient] yes , that's correct .\r\n[doctor] great . well ... all right . it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we're gon na figure it all out , uh , here today . um , speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there . would that be all right with you , ashley ?\r\n[patient] yeah , that sounds good .\r\n[doctor] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today .\r\n[patient_guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .\r\n[doctor] okay .\r\n[patient] we automatically thought appendix .\r\n[doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense .\r\n[patient_guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .\r\n[doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ?\r\n[patient_guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .\r\n[doctor] okay .\r\n[patient_guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .\r\n[doctor] wow . okay .\r\n[patient_guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .\r\n[doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ?\r\n[patient_guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .\r\n[doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ?\r\n[patient_guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .\r\n[doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel .\r\n[patient_guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .\r\n[doctor] mhm . okay .\r\n[patient_guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .\r\n[doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ?\r\n[patient_guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .\r\n[doctor] got you . okay .\r\n[patient_guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .\r\n[doctor] hmm . okay .\r\n[patient_guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .\r\n[doctor] yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ?\r\n[patient_guest] only pepcid .\r\n[doctor] okay .\r\n[patient_guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .\r\n[doctor] all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ?\r\n[patient_guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .\r\n[doctor] great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ?\r\n[patient_guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .\r\n[doctor] okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ?\r\n[patient_guest] yes , that is correct . he did .\r\n[doctor] okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ?\r\n[patient_guest] yes , and they did n't catch it in time .\r\n[doctor] i'm so sorry to hear that .\r\n[patient_guest] yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .\r\n[doctor] my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care .\r\n[patient_guest] you're welcome .\r\n[doctor] okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ?\r\n[patient_guest] yes . well , it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt .\r\n[doctor] okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned .\r\n[patient_guest] um , this is what she sent me , \" end-stage renal disease . chronic kidney disease stage five , diabetes , hypertension . \" that's all i have , uh , to work on for her .\r\n[doctor] okay . uh , and that's ... okay . let me see . that is all when ... she was an adult when all of that happened ?\r\n[patient_guest] correct . yep .\r\n[doctor] all right-y . okay . and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist , where they did n't find anything sig ... clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did .\r\n[patient_guest] yes .\r\n[doctor] okay . so that's all good . so , ashley , um , a few questions for you if that's all right . how are you feeling right now ?\r\n[patient] i'm not feeling too bad . my stomach just hurts just a little bit . it's burning a little bit .\r\n[doctor] okay . and any pain when you go pee ?\r\n[patient] sometimes it's just hard to start , sometimes .\r\n[doctor] okay . and any blood in your pee ?\r\n[patient] no , not that i've noticed .\r\n[doctor] okay .\r\n[patient_guest] she does complain that it burns when she pees when she drinks certain drinks , um , like , soda . so she'll only drink gatorade or water .\r\n[doctor] okay . yeah . so we do see that some people are very sensitive when the drink certain items , especially the carbonation . um , it can make it burn a little bit when they urinate . um ... okay . so a lot of different pictures of her kidneys here , and we'll review all of that here in a moment . um-\r\n[patient_guest] okay .\r\n[doctor] all right-y . but before we review that , i wan na look through a quick exam , uh , and just see how things are doing . you'll hear me speak aloud the exam just to make sure i'm getting everything documented .\r\n[patient_guest] okay .\r\n[doctor] all right-y . please use my physical exam template . so , ashley , i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart , if you'll just breathe normally for me . okay ?\r\n[patient] okay .\r\n[doctor] good . lungs and heart sound great . all right-y . so your physical exam , you know , everything we see up here is ... you know , you're a well-appearing female , alert and oriented , sitting comfortably on my chair today , i hope , uh , with not acute distress . exam , um , otherwise with norm ... within normal limits . okay . so where does that all leave us ? the good news is that her kidney functions do look good as- as does her blood pressure . we'll wan na keep on eye on both of those things , as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call proteinuria , which is where your kidneys do n't work as well as they should and we end of seeing protein in your pee .\r\n[patient_guest] okay .\r\n[doctor] or , excuse me , her pee . uh , her right kidney is a little bit smaller which is making her left kidney work harder , possibly causing the left to appear bigger , um , and it's something that we wan na keep an eye on but nothing for us to do with anything today .\r\n[patient_guest] okay . thank you .\r\n[doctor] i also recommend that , on an annual basis , we do kind of the following things . so i wan na have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function , complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her ... in her pee , and do a blood pressure check . additionally , let's avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt to use tylenol instead .\r\n[patient_guest] okay . that sounds good .\r\n[doctor] okay . and does ashley play any sports ?\r\n[patient_guest] yes . she is active in softball and she wants to join the drill team over the summer .\r\n[doctor] how fun . i used to play softball back in the day . um , so it'll be very important that during those activities she stays well-hydrated . i really wan na avoid dehydration , as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys . so i'm gon na recommend at least two liters per day of water .\r\n[patient_guest] okay . great . we will work on that .\r\n[doctor] okay . i also recommended a healthy diet and continue her active lifestyle . this will help keep her and her kidneys healthier as an adult . so if we can start those behaviors early , we'll be in a good space as she progresses .\r\n[patient_guest] we can do that . we already do try to eat , uh , very well .\r\n[doctor] good . good . so for her next appointment , she can either meet with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to you guys at home . you do n't have come all the way out here .\r\n[patient_guest] okay . that sounds great .\r\n[doctor] okay . that was a lot . do we need any additional questions clarified or anything ? um , you can always give us or your primary a call if you think of anything or if ... certainly , if symptoms worse .\r\n[patient_guest] no . i do n't have any additional questions , and i'll- i'll definitely give you a- a

valves and obstructive neur- neuropathy . uh , he developed chronic kidney disease and was on dial ... was dialysis-dependent . he had a renal transplant which subsequently failed , died of dialysis in his 40s . , wait . is that right ?\r\n[patient_guest] now that you've started , it does ... i do n't understand the he unless they were giving ... , the grandfather's record . but did you wan na do

Only include sections for which there is sufficient information available.\n     CHIEF COMPLAINT\nAbnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\nAshley James, a 14-year-old female with no prior significant medical history, presented for evaluation of an abnormal renal ultrasound revealing an atrophic right kidney. She initially experienced severe abdominal pain on the right side, leading to multiple visits to healthcare providers due to persistent symptoms including vomiting and localized pain. Ultrasound findings indicated a significantly smaller right kidney compared to the left, along with cystic changes and possible infection. Family history includes renal disease in her father, who required a kidney transplant, and her aunt with end-stage renal disease. No significant family history of other conditions was reported.\n\nVITALS\nNot provided in the transcript.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\nAshley appeared well-nourished and alert. Vital signs were within normal limits. Heart and lung examinations were unremarkable. The abdomen was soft with mild tenderness on the right flank. No edema was noted. The right kidney was palpable and slightly smaller than the left, consistent with ultrasound findings.\n\nRESULTS\nUltrasound revealed an atrophic right kidney with cystic changes and possible infection. Blood tests showed normal renal function indicators. Genetic testing for significant mutations was negative.\n\nASSESSMENT\nAshley James presents with an atrophic right kidney likely secondary to chronic disease, possibly related to a severe infection in childhood. The differential diagnosis includes congenital anomalies, chronic kidney disease, and potential familial predisposition given the family history of renal disease.\n\nPLAN\nThe management plan includes monitoring kidney function and size via annual ultrasounds, routine urinalysis to detect proteinuria or hematuria, and maintaining hydration and avoiding NSAIDs. Lifestyle recommendations include a healthy diet and regular physical activity. Referral to an adult nephrologist for ongoing care is advised. Education on recognizing signs of worsening renal function and the importance of adherence to the management plan will be provided.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Continue current medications (Pepcid and Claritin).\n2. Maintain adequate hydration with at least 2 liters of water daily.\n3. Avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n4. Follow up with primary care physician or adult nephrologist annually for monitoring.\n5. Report any new or worsening symptoms immediately.

    "source": "[doctor] okay . next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12/27/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female , uh , who was previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . hi . good afternoon , ashley . how are you doing ?\r\n[patient] i'm doing okay . how are you .\r\n[doctor] i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad .\r\n[patient] yes , that's correct .\r\n[doctor] great . well ... all right . it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we're gon na figure it all out , uh , here today . um , speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there . would that be all right with you , ashley ?\r\n[patient] yeah , that sounds good .\r\n[doctor] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today .\r\n[patient_guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .\r\n[doctor] okay .\r\n[patient] we automatically thought appendix .\r\n[doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense .\r\n[patient_guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .\r\n[doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ?\r\n[patient_guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .\r\n[doctor] okay .\r\n[patient_guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .\r\n[doctor] wow . okay .\r\n[patient_guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .\r\n[doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ?\r\n[patient_guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .\r\n[doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ?\r\n[patient_guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .\r\n[doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel .\r\n[patient_guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .\r\n[doctor] mhm . okay .\r\n[patient_guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .\r\n[doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ?\r\n[patient_guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .\r\n[doctor] got you . okay .\r\n[patient_guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .\r\n[doctor] hmm . okay .\r\n[patient_guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .\r\n[doctor] yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ?\r\n[patient_guest] only pepcid .\r\n[doctor] okay .\r\n[patient_guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .\r\n[doctor] all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ?\r\n[patient_guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .\r\n[doctor] great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ?\r\n[patient_guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .\r\n[doctor] okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ?\r\n[patient_guest] yes , that is correct . he did .\r\n[doctor] okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ?\r\n[patient_guest] yes , and they did n't catch it in time .\r\n[doctor] i'm so sorry to hear that .\r\n[patient_guest] yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .\r\n[doctor] my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care .\r\n[patient_guest] you're welcome .\r\n[doctor] okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ?\r\n[patient_guest] yes . well , it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt .\r\n[doctor] okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned .\r\n[patient_guest] um , this is what she sent me , \" end-stage renal disease . chronic kidney disease stage five , diabetes , hypertension . \" that's all i have , uh , to work on for her .\r\n[doctor] okay . uh , and that's ... okay . let me see . that is all when ... she was an adult when all of that happened ?\r\n[patient_guest] correct . yep .\r\n[doctor] all right-y . okay . and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist , where they did n't find anything sig ... clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did .\r\n[patient_guest] yes .\r\n[doctor] okay . so that's all good . so , ashley , um , a few questions for you if that's all right . how are you feeling right now ?\r\n[patient] i'm not feeling too bad . my stomach just hurts just a little bit . it's burning a little bit .\r\n[doctor] okay . and any pain when you go pee ?\r\n[patient] sometimes it's just hard to start , sometimes .\r\n[doctor] okay . and any blood in your pee ?\r\n[patient] no , not that i've noticed .\r\n[doctor] okay .\r\n[patient_guest] she does complain that it burns when she pees when she drinks certain drinks , um , like , soda . so she'll only drink gatorade or water .\r\n[doctor] okay . yeah . so we do see that some people are very sensitive when the drink certain items , especially the carbonation . um , it can make it burn a little bit when they urinate . um ... okay . so a lot of different pictures of her kidneys here , and we'll review all of that here in a moment . um-\r\n[patient_guest] okay .\r\n[doctor] all right-y . but before we review that , i wan na look through a quick exam , uh , and just see how things are doing . you'll hear me speak aloud the exam just to make sure i'm getting everything documented .\r\n[patient_guest] okay .\r\n[doctor] all right-y . please use my physical exam template . so , ashley , i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart , if you'll just breathe normally for me . okay ?\r\n[patient] okay .\r\n[doctor] good . lungs and heart sound great . all right-y . so your physical exam , you know , everything we see up here is ... you know , you're a well-appearing female , alert and oriented , sitting comfortably on my chair today , i hope , uh , with not acute distress . exam , um , otherwise with norm ... within normal limits . okay . so where does that all leave us ? the good news is that her kidney functions do look good as- as does her blood pressure . we'll wan na keep on eye on both of those things , as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call proteinuria , which is where your kidneys do n't work as well as they should and we end of seeing protein in your pee .\r\n[patient_guest] okay .\r\n[doctor] or , excuse me , her pee . uh , her right kidney is a little bit smaller which is making her left kidney work harder , possibly causing the left to appear bigger , um , and it's something that we wan na keep an eye on but nothing for us to do with anything today .\r\n[patient_guest] okay . thank you .\r\n[doctor] i also recommend that , on an annual basis , we do kind of the following things . so i wan na have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function , complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her ... in her pee , and do a blood pressure check . additionally , let's avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt to use tylenol instead .\r\n[patient_guest] okay . that sounds good .\r\n[doctor] okay . and does ashley play any sports ?\r\n[patient_guest] yes . she is active in softball and she wants to join the drill team over the summer .\r\n[doctor] how fun . i used to play softball back in the day . um , so it'll be very important that during those activities she stays well-hydrated . i really wan na avoid dehydration , as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys . so i'm gon na recommend at least two liters per day of water .\r\n[patient_guest] okay . great . we will work on that .\r\n[doctor] okay . i also recommended a healthy diet and continue her active lifestyle . this will help keep her and her kidneys healthier as an adult . so if we can start those behaviors early , we'll be in a good space as she progresses .\r\n[patient_guest] we can do that . we already do try to eat , uh , very well

here .\r\n[patient_guest] okay . that sounds great .\r\n[doctor] okay . that was a lot . do we need any additional questions clarified or anything ? um , you can always give us or your primary a call if you think of anything or if ... certainly , if symptoms worse .\r\n[patient_guest] no . i do n't have any additional questions , and i'll- i'll definitely give you a- a phone call if we do . and thank you so much . this was so helpful .\r\n[doctor] awesome . well , thank you guys for making the trip . and , ashley , it was really nice to meet you . mom dad , you as well . and i hope you guys take care .\r\n[patient_guest] you too .\r\n[doctor] all right-y . past medical history , review of patient's grandfather's record , we see he had posterior urethral bowels valves and obstructive neur- neuropathy . uh , he developed chronic kidney disease and was on dial ... was dialysis-dependent . he had a renal transplant which subsequently failed , died of dialysis in his 40s . , wait . is

    "reference": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\r\n\r\nEvaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\r\n\r\nNext patient Ashley James is a 14-year-old female, previously healthy, who is here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.\r\n\r\nThe father details a history of the patient coming home sick one day with extreme right-sided abdominal pain. Her parents brought her for evaluation, and they treated her for a stomach virus and administered fluids prior to sending her home. The next day, the patient's pain was more severe. The patient returned to the doctor's office and an ultrasound and additional testing was performed which revealed left kidney hypertrophy. At that time, they were encouraged to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was seen briefly by her physician the next day, which was insignificant. Ashley was still experiencing stomach pain and vomiting, her father brought her to another facility in Jacksonville. At that location, the patient's family received information that her right kidney was nonfunctioning, atrophic, and smaller than her left kidney. Additionally, cysts on her kidneys, ovaries, and other locations were found. Her lymph nodes were swollen, and she had \"a lot of infections\". The patient was sent back to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was unable to follow back up with her primary care physician as he was still out of town. The patient came to Atlanta, remained here for 4 days, was evaluated and treated with subsequent improvement of her symptoms. She has not vomited since.\r\n\r\nPrior to her current medical complaints, the patient was healthy. The etiology of her kidney issues is believed to have been caused by some severe infection the patient experienced, possibly as a child.\r\n\r\nWhen the patient was 4 years old, she was hospitalized 3 or 4 times, for up to 2-3 days each time. She received fluids and antibiotics, and then discharged. Her father reports that no workup was ever performed to rule out infections during these hospitalizations. A week or 2 post-discharge the fever and symptoms would return. This kept recurring for approximately 2 months and then it spontaneously resolved.\r\n\r\nThe patient is still experiencing some stomach burning. She reports hesitancy while urinating and she states she has to wait for her urinary flow to commence. She endorses occasional dysuria. Ashley denies hematuria. Some beverages are associated with dysuria, thus the patient drinks mainly water, Gatorade and V8 juice.\r\n\r\nSOCIAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe patient plays on softball team and is interested in joining a drill team over the summer.\r\n\r\nFAMILY HISTORY\r\n\r\nPaternal Grandfather: Deceased approximately 47. Myocardial Infarction. Posterior Urethral Valves. Obstructive Neuropathy. End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease was Dialysis dependent. Failed Renal Transplant.\r\nPaternal Great Aunt: End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease is Dialysis dependent. Type II Diabetes. Hypertension.\r\n\r\nNo family history of polycystic kidney disease.\r\n\r\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\r\n\r\nPepcid 40 mg once daily.\r\nClaritin as needed for allergies.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL EXAM\r\n\r\nConstitutional\r\nWell-appearing female adolescent, sitting comfortably on the exam table in no acute distress.\r\n\r\nNeurological\r\nAlert.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nAbdominal ultrasound, 03/22/2021.\r\nCT abdomen and pelvis, 03/22/2021.\r\nCMP, 03/22/2021.\r\n\r\nASSESSMENT\r\n\r\n• Renal hypoplasia.\r\nAshley is a 14-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney. She has right-sided renal hypoplasia with a small atrophic right kidney discovered incidentally on imaging for abdominal pain. Imaging shows compensatory hypertrophy of her left kidney. Otherwise, she shows no sequelae of chronic kidney disease and enjoys normal blood pressure. Her urinalysis is without sediment. She has normal kidney function with creatinine of 0.62, which equates to an estimated GFR of greater than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m², and normal serum electrolytes and acid base status. Ashley is at higher risk of hypertension and proteinuria, which will need to be followed annually.\r\n\r\nPLAN\r\n\r\nYearly ultrasound to monitor the hypertrophic left kidney and atrophic right kidney. Also, on an annual basis I recommend completion of a urinalysis to assess for proteinuria and blood pressure checks. The patient should avoid use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and use Tylenol for pain and fever. It is also recommended that she stay well hydrated, avoiding dehydration, especially while participating in sports, by consuming 2 L of water per day. I counseled the patient and family about the importance of a healthy diet and remaining active to avoid future comorbidities that may put her at increased risk for chronic kidney disease as in adult.\r\n\r\nThe patient does not need to follow up with a pediatric nephrologist but can instead follow up with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to home.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nSchedule follow up appointment with local adult nephrologist or primary care physician."

would you say\r\n[patient] i do n't know i this is probably like my seventh or eighth kidney stone\r\n[doctor] seven or eight kidney stones so do you think you passed it yet or is it still in the\r\n[patient] i think this one passed yeah\r\n[doctor] this one passed how long would you say it took to\r\n[patient] well i went last week and then i think it passed about three days

it myself and i'm a provider so i definitely understand yeah i know we we talked about last time you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking those about two to three times a week so what have those readings been i'm usually like one thirty to one forty over sixty to seventy\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] that's that's that's not too bad i think when you first came in you were around like one

little bit about my assessment and plan for you and so my assessment you you did have the those kidney stones but i i think they are passed this time but i do want to get a couple of labs so we'll get a urinalysis\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] alright we'll get a urine culture just to make sure everything is is cleared up i also want to give you a referral to referral referral to

    "system_output": "\n    CONVERSATION:\n    [doctor] angela good to see you today so i'm writing here in my notes that you're you're coming in you had some left knee pain so how did you hurt your knee\r\n[patient] yeah so i hurt my knee the other day when i was running around with my niece she she is learning how to take off the training wheels for her bike\r\n[doctor] mm-hmm\r\n[patient] and i fell and i think i twisted my knee in some kind of funky way\r\n[doctor] okay that that that that's not good how old are your niece\r\n[patient] she is five and perfect\r\n[doctor] well that's good that you're trying to help her with the learning how to ride a bike\r\n[patient] yeah\r\n[doctor] that sounds fun but i'm i'm sad as you hurt your knee doing it so for your knee pain are you are you able to bear weight on that leg the left leg\r\n[patient] well i've been limping ever since and it really has n't gotten better so i thought it was maybe time to come see you because it happened about a week ago\r\n[doctor] yeah yeah it's a definitely a good time to come see me so what part of your knee would you say it hurts\r\n[patient] honestly it's been hurting on both sides more so on the inside than the the outside\r\n[doctor] so okay so more in the medial aspect less on the lateral okay that makes sense and you said did you hear a pop when you when you twisted it\r\n[patient] yeah i did\r\n[doctor] okay alright so how would you rate your pain with your knee out of out of one to ten\r\n[patient] it started off as like a four but i think it's getting worse and it's starting like it's it's like a like a throbbing kind of pain yeah\r\n[doctor] alright and have you taken anything for the pain\r\n[patient] yeah so i i had like a ulcer not too long ago so my doctor told me that i could n't take any like kind of advil or ibuprofen\r\n[doctor] mm-hmm\r\n[patient] so i've been taking some tylenol and i wrapped it with kinesiology tape are you familiar with that\r\n[doctor] yep yeah i'm i'm familiar\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] alright and has the has the ibuprofen been helping you at all\r\n[patient] i ca n't take ibuprofen\r\n[doctor] i mean i'm sorry the tylenol\r\n[patient] no it's okay but the tylenol it helps like a little bit but you know like it's it's got like a time limit right so by the time and i'm not supposed to take it like more than like every like four hours or something like that but by hour or two like it it hurts again\r\n[doctor] okay yeah that yeah you ca n't take too much of that tylenol because it'll it'll mess up your liver definitely\r\n[patient] right\r\n[doctor] alright so go ahead and do a quick exam on your knee here so when i press here does that hurt\r\n[patient] yeah like when you press on the inside that hurts a lot\r\n[doctor] okay alright i'm gon na do a couple of other other maneuvers here for your knee so on your left knee exam i do appreciate some edema you also have some effusion some fluid in the knee you have moderate range of motion so you're able to move it a little bit but not all the way i also see you have some pain on flexion and extension of the knee even negative lachman's test and a negative valgus and varus test as well so all that to say is i do n't think anything is is torn in your knee based on the your physical exam so we did do a x-ray of your left knee and luckily it was normal so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so everything is good there so let me talk to you little bit about my assessment and plan for your knee okay\r\n[patient] yeah\r\n[doctor] alright so for your your left knee pain i believe you you have a mcl strain or a medial collateral ligament that's the inside of your knee i think when you were running with your knee she had somehow twisted it and so you strained that ligament there so for that what i want to do i'm going to give you some pain medication that's not an nsaid so i will put you on some tramadol you can take fifty milligrams you can do that twice a day and then you can take that tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain alright i'm gon na put you in a knee immobilizer leg knee immobilizer and you can wear that for the next week i just wan na keep the knee from moving so it can heal a little bit and reduce some of the inflammation that you're seeing here and i also want you to ice it and you can do that three or four times a day for twenty thirty minutes at a time and that should help some of that swelling as well and i i you know i know your niece is gon na be upset but i just do n't want you to be running probably for the next three weeks with her just to help us get time to let allow the knee to heal so how does that sound\r\n[patient] that's alright how long do you think it'll be before i can like run or something like that\r\n[doctor] hmmm i think you'll be back to normal in about a month the strain does n't seem too bad but we just need to get you off of the knee so we can allow it to heal i mean once we do that you know along with you know the icing the mobilization and you taking the medication i think you'll be good to go in a month if you do feel like you're getting a little bit worse please feel free to call the office and we can get you in and possibly do more imaging such as an mri to you know to see if it's anything worse but i do n't think it is but just let us know how you

The pain began immediately after the incident and has persisted, worsening over the past week. The patient initially rated the pain as a 4/10, but it has increased to a throbbing sensation around 7/10. She has been unable to bear full weight on the affected leg and has been limping since the injury. The patient heard a popping sound during the incident. She has tried over-the-counter pain relief (Tylenol) and kinesiology taping, but finds these measures only provide temporary relief. She cannot take NSAIDs due to a recent ulcer and has been advised against them by her doctor.\n\n    VITALS\n    No specific vital signs provided in the transcript.\n\n    PHYSICAL EXAM\n    Examination reveals edema and effusion in the left knee, moderate range of motion, and pain on both flexion and extension. There is no evidence of a fracture or bony abnormality on X-ray. The patient exhibits pain on palpation of the medial aspect of the knee. Negative Lachman's, valgus, and varus tests indicate no significant ligamentous instability.\n\n    RESULTS\n    X-ray of the left knee shows no fractures or bony abnormalities. Physical examination suggests a medial collateral ligament (MCL) strain.\n\n    ASSESSMENT\n    Diagnosis: Medial collateral ligament (MCL) strain of the left knee.\n\n    PLAN\n    Prescribe Tramadol 50 mg twice daily for pain management, avoiding NSAIDs due to ulcer history. Instruct the patient to use a knee immobilizer for the next week to restrict movement and promote healing. Advise the patient to apply ice to the knee three to four times daily for 20-30 minutes to reduce swelling. Recommend avoiding activities that exacerbate the pain, particularly running, for approximately three weeks. Provide education on the importance of allowing the knee to heal before resuming high-impact activities. Instruct the patient to contact the office if symptoms worsen or if further evaluation is needed, such as an MRI.\n\n    INSTRUCTIONS\n    - Take Tramadol 50 mg twice daily for pain control.\n    - Use a knee immobilizer for the next week.\n    - Apply ice to the knee three to four times daily for 20-30 minutes.\n    - Avoid running or high-impact activities for three weeks.\n    - Contact the office if symptoms worsen or if further evaluation is needed.

my knee the other day when i was running around with my niece she she is learning how to take off the training wheels for her bike\r\n[doctor] mm-hmm\r\n[patient] and i fell and i think i twisted my knee in some kind of funky way\r\n[doctor] okay that that that that's not good how old are your niece\r\n[patient] she is five and perfect\r\n[doctor] well that's good that you're trying to help her with the learning how to ride a bike\r\n[patient] yeah\r\n[doctor] that sounds fun but i'm i'm sad as you hurt your knee doing it so for your knee pain are you are you able to bear weight on that leg the left leg\r\n[patient] well i've been limping ever since and it really has n't gotten better so i thought it was maybe time to come see you because it happened about a week ago\r\n[doctor] yeah yeah it's a definitely a good time to come see me so what part of your knee would you say it hurts\r\n[patient] honestly it's been hurting on both sides more so on the inside than the the outside\r\n[doctor] so okay so more in the medial aspect less on the lateral okay that makes sense and you said did you hear a pop when you when you twisted it\r\n[patient] yeah i did\r\n[doctor] okay alright so how would you rate your pain with your knee out of out of one to ten\r\n[patient] it started off as like a four but i think it's getting worse and it's starting like it's it's like a like a throbbing kind of pain yeah\r\n[doctor] alright and have you taken anything for the pain\r\n[patient] yeah so i i had like a ulcer not too long ago so my doctor told me that i could n't take any like kind of advil or ibuprofen\r\n[doctor] mm-hmm\r\n[patient] so i've been taking some tylenol and i wrapped it with kinesiology tape are you familiar with that\r\n[doctor] yep yeah i'm i'm familiar\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] alright and has the has the ibuprofen been helping you at all\r\n[patient] i ca n't take ibuprofen\r\n[doctor] i mean i'm sorry the tylenol\r\n[patient] no it's okay but the tylenol it helps like a little bit but you know like it's it's got like a time limit right so by the time and i'm not supposed to take it like more than like every like four hours or something like that but by hour or two like it it hurts again\r\n[doctor] okay yeah that yeah you ca n't take too much of that tylenol because it'll it'll mess up your liver definitely\r\n[patient] right\r\n[doctor] alright so go ahead and do a quick exam on your knee here so when i press here does that hurt\r\n[patient] yeah like when you press on the inside that hurts a lot\r\n[doctor] okay alright i'm gon na do a couple of other other maneuvers here for your knee so on your left knee exam i do appreciate some edema you also have some effusion some fluid in the knee you have moderate range of motion so you're able to move it a little bit but not all the way i also see you have some pain on flexion and extension of the knee even negative lachman's test and a negative valgus and varus test as well so all that to say is i do n't think anything is is torn in your knee based on the your physical exam so we did do a x-ray of your left knee and luckily it was normal so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so everything is good there so let me talk to you little bit about my assessment and plan for your knee okay\r\n[patient] yeah\r\n[doctor] alright so for your your left knee pain i believe you you have a mcl strain or a medial collateral ligament that's the inside of your knee i think when you were running with your knee she had somehow twisted it and so you strained that ligament there so for that what i want to do i'm going to give you some pain medication that's not an nsaid so i will put you on some tramadol you can take fifty milligrams you can do that twice a day and then you can take that tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain alright i'm gon na put you in a knee immobilizer leg knee immobilizer and you can wear that for the next week i just wan na keep the knee from moving so it can heal a little bit and reduce some of the inflammation that you're seeing here and i also want you to ice it and you can do that three or four times a day for twenty thirty minutes at a time and that should help some of that swelling as well and i i you know i know your niece is gon na be upset but i just do n't want you to be running probably for the next three weeks with her just to help us get time to let allow the knee to heal so how does that sound\r\n[patient] that's alright how long do you think it'll be before i can like run or something like that\r\n[doctor] hmmm i think you'll be back to normal in about a month the strain does n't seem too bad but we just need to get you off of the knee so we can allow it to heal i mean once we do that you know along with you know the icing the mobilization and you taking the medication i think you'll be good to go in a month if you do feel like you're getting a little bit worse please feel free to call the office and we can get you in and possibly do more imaging such as an mri to you know to see if it's anything worse but i do n't think it is but just let us know how you feel in a couple of days\r\n[patient] okay alright thanks\r\n[doctor] alright any other questions\r\n[patient] no that's it\r\n[doctor] alright great thanks",
    "reference": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\r\n\r\nAngela Powell is a pleasant 81-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left knee pain. The onset of her pain began 1 week ago, when she was running around with her niece and fell. At the time of the injury, she heard a pop and believes that she twisted her knee. She reports that she has been limping since the injury. The patient locates her pain to the medial and lateral aspects of her knee. She rates her pain level as a 4 out of 10, however this is increasing. Her pain is described as a throbbing pain. The patient has been taking Tylenol, which has provided mild and temporary relief, as well as wrapping her knee with kinesiology tape. She states that she is unable to take ibuprofen secondary to an ulcer.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL EXAM\r\n\r\nMSK: Examination of the left knee: Edema and effusion noted. Moderate ROM. Pain with flexion and extension of the knee. Negative Lachman's. Negative valgus and varus stress test.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\n4 views of the left knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or dislocations. No other abnormalities are noted.\r\n\r\nASSESSMENT\r\n\r\nLeft knee pain, possible MCL strain.\r\n\r\nPLAN\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have discussed with the patient that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a tear. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. The plan is to place the patient in a knee immobilizer to provide increased support for the next week. I have also prescribed the patient tramadol 50 mg to treat her pain. She can take Tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain. I have also advised her to ice her left knee 3 to 4 times a day for 20 to 30 minutes at a time. I have advised her to refrain from running for the next 3 weeks. If her pain does not improve with the immobilizer, I will recommend obtaining an MRI.\r\n"

[patient] his notable things are # 1 , he is on 1 ml every 10 days . his levels were less than 300 to begin with . he is on finasteride currently . he also takes cialis daily , so he takes all his pills just from me , patient's other area of concern is gynecomastia , which is , which we will discuss with him today . his last psa was 0.66 and his last testosterone was greater than 1500 . [doctor] hey , how are you today ? [patient] alright , how you been ? [doctor] i'm good . [patient] good , good . [doctor] have you lost some weight or you at least putting on some muscle , you look trump . [patient] no , i think i'm pretty much the same as i've always been . [doctor] really ? okay , maybe it's just your black shirt , makes you look then . [patient] yeah , i guess that's it . [doctor] so health wise , how is everything going ? [patient] good , the testosterone is going well . [doctor] that's great . [patient] helped me out , i feel good , more vigorous , sleeping well and i think it's having some positive effects , not so much physically because like i said , i've i've been this way my whole life , but i'm seeing some good improvements in my blood work . [doctor] okay , well , that's good . [patient] so the finasteride i am only taking half a pill , it's the 5 mg one . [doctor] yeah , i remember you telling me that . [patient] and cialis on the days i work out , i take 5 mg , otherwise i take 2-1/2 mg pills , but i have been out of it . [doctor] okay . [patient] but overall i'm doing well . i'm actually taking the correct steps to get my life together . [doctor] good . it's always great to hear . let's look i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs . [patient] okay . [doctor] please use my general exam template alright just take a few breaths . [patient] okay . [doctor] now . alright everything sounds good , no concerns there . [patient] great . so i wanted to show you something . [doctor] sure . [patient] look at this . [doctor] okay , this is your cholesterol . [patient] yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 mg/dl , then i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th . [doctor] right . [patient] now 5 months later look at my numbers . [doctor] wow , that's remarkable . [patient] this is the test , it's the only change . i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this i mean there is a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement meaning those who get good levels of their tests see their diabetic control improve . [doctor] yeah . but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless we will take it . [patient] i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping . [doctor] yeah , that's an unbelievable difference . [patient] 145 mg/dl from 265 mg/dl is awesome . i also read that it it's cardioprotective . [doctor] absolutely . [patient] my red blood cell count has increased . [doctor] yeah , i saw that . it's fine though . [patient] stable . [doctor] your psa a today is also is good also . it's 0.6 i think . [patient] yeah is it ? [doctor] yeah , it was 0.5 last year and anything under four is good . [patient] nice , such good news . [doctor] so it just needs to be checked every year or so . [patient] so in terms of estrogen control , i've been hearing that indol three carbonal or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ? yeah , i've heard of it , but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean your levels are fine and we checked your estradiol and it was not elevated , so . okay . [doctor] i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do anymore tests anymore than test once a year , excuse me . [patient] okay . what about increasing my testosterone to 175 mg . i'm at 140 now . [doctor] well , your levels are high . [patient] are they right now ? [doctor] well , i mean they were last time . [patient] yeah , but i just just injected though where i had right before that was taken . [doctor] i know , i know you had then . when did you inject this time ? [patient] i figured i'm on my eighth day today . [doctor] okay . [patient] so i'm due to dose on thursday or friday . [doctor] alright . [patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and teas on it , that helps me . [doctor] that's a great idea . so look the biggest issue i've seen even if your levels today are around 700 is that your peaks are getting greater than 1500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness and your risk will only go up the higher the dose that we go on . [patient] okay . [doctor] you look well , your levels are good and you are feeling well . [patient] yeah , i'm feeling good . [doctor] i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you are feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean i get it , and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses and then they would have a heart attack at 50 . [patient] yeah , they have to be taking a lot . [doctor] likely they are taking more than testosterone but still . [patient] and they are taking stuff for a long time . [doctor] true but right now i would not change your dose . [patient] okay . [doctor] makes sense ? [patient] it does , i appreciate the discussion . [doctor] no problem . what pharmacy are you using ? have you changed it or anything ? [patient] no changes , i use walmart pharmacy . i do need more cialis and finasteride . [doctor] okay . [patient] i would prefer the paper prescription . [doctor] for all of them ? [patient] sure . [doctor] alright , we will do . let me go get your prescriptions .

    "reference": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\r\n\r\nHypogonadism.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\r\n\r\nMr. Paul Edwards is a 59-year-old male, an established patient, who presents to the clinic today for hypogonadism. He was last seen on 11/24/2020. The patient’s history includes positive for HIV, and today he is concerned with gynecomastia.\r\n\r\nThe patient is doing well, overall, and feels the testosterone is helping. He reports weight stability, feels lively, good, more vigorous, and he is sleeping well. He also thinks the testosterone is having a positive effect on his blood work. He endorses that his triglycerides have always been elevated and adds that they were as high as 265 mg/dL. The patient presented a copy of his bloodwork, showing a significant decrease in his cholesterol after 5 months. Mr. Edwards questioned if the changes in his blood work were due to the testosterone. He also noted that his red blood cell count has not increased. The patient inquired about possible benefits of Indole-3-carbinol, which is a broccoli extract for estrogen control.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the patient is dosing 140 ng/dL of testosterone per week and inquired if his dose could be increased to 175 ng/dL. He recalled that he had recently injected testosterone before his last testosterone blood work was performed; last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL. The patient confirms continued daily use of Finasteride and Cialis, prescribed by me, and stated he needs a refill for both.\r\n\r\nMr. Edwards mentioned he is taking correct steps to get his life \"together.\" He also uses a med calendar to help with medication compliance.\r\n\r\nPAST HISTORY\r\n\r\nMedical\r\nHIV\r\n\r\nSOCIAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nUtilizes med calendar to support medication compliance.\r\nActively trying to get his life together.\r\n\r\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\r\n\r\nCialis 5 mg tablet by mouth on days he exercises, 2.5 mg tablet by mouth on days without exercise.\r\nFinasteride 5 mg half tablet daily.\r\nTestosterone cypionate 140 mg.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nPSA 0.6 ng/mL.\r\nTriglycerides 145 mg/dL.\r\nTotal testosterone 1500 ng/dL, 11/24/2021.\r\n\r\nASSESSMENT\r\n\r\n• Hypogonadism.\r\n\r\nPLAN\r\n\r\nI recommend maintaining current management. The patient’s last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL, although this level was likely related to his recent injection. He requested an increase to his testosterone cypionate from 140 mg to 175 mg, which I denied due to his already high testosterone levels. I counseled the patient on the risks associated with high testosterone levels and Indole-3-carbinol and it’s lacking evidence to support his estrogen levels. The last time his estradiol levels were checked, they were normal; recommend annual screening.\r\n\r\nI provided paper prescription refills for Cialis and Finasteride.\r\n"

these days\r\n[doctor] alright\r\n[patient] so\r\n[doctor] but what about at home how about your siblings are any of them sick\r\n[patient] most of them are healthy yeah most of them are healthy although you know i have a brother who smokes i have told him not to smoke he does n't listen\r\n[doctor] mm-hmm\r\n[patient] house told not to smoke at the house but you know anyway\r\n[doctor] okay so there is a smoker at home you know that does that does affect you so we might have to have a conversation with your brother and anybody else but it's good to know that people are n't sick i do see here though that you have kind of a a history of recurrent strep like you you seem to be having these sore throats a lot i think it says that you've had four in the last five months is that correct\r\n[patient] yeah strep and bfs i'm not quite sure what it is just seems to come on you know i get this sore throat and fibroid i'm told i have strep\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] sometimes you know my doctor knows what he is doing strep everyday strep everyday but anyway if he says i have strep then i have strep\r\n[doctor] i okay i respect that and i'm glad that you you listen to him at the end of the day that's always a good thing alright so now that we've gotten like kind of a lot of the history out of the way i do want to do my physical exam is that okay\r\n[patient] sure\r\n[doctor] alright so when i look in your throat like i'm not noticing any erythema no swelling your tonsils are midline so those look good when i'm feeling here on your neck i'm not appreciating any like lymphadenopathy no cervical adenopathy and like i wan na check those things because i just wan na make sure i'm not seeing any physical signs of like any kind of strep right now right i do n't want i wan na make sure you're not having an infection when i listen to your lungs i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales rhonchi that means i'm not hearing funky sounds your heart sounds great no murmur no rub no gallop when i press on your back remember you told me you had that left back pain when i press on it does it hurt\r\n[patient] no\r\n[doctor] okay alright great no tenderness on palpation when i press on your abdomen are you feeling any pain\r\n[patient] no\r\n[doctor] alright no rebound no guarding that's great okay so based on my physical exam we are gon na have a couple conversations one that ct that your your primary care doctor the the one that you you question his judgment it is showing a couple things that we are a little concerned about it could be that these recurrent strep episodes that you've been having it looks like they are like potentially that they are caused something called glomerulonephritis right there's just some some swelling here and we have to be careful of something like that because it could lead to like kidney disease chronic kidney disease and we wan na make sure that we cut that off right so the first thing is i'm gon na refer you for your problem of glomerulonephritis i'm gon na refer you to an ent i want them to look at you and maybe consider taking out your tonsils to see if that could help with some of the recurrent strep though that you're feeling but i would like to leave that to them to make that decision for you and me we're gon na do some more like confirmations right i'm gon na order some labs i want several a lipid panel a ua a cmp a cbc a vitamin d and a tsh all of these things will give me more information about kind of like what's happening in your body right now in terms of like your hormones and you know your iron levels and to make sure that you are like getting all the nutrition that you need and that your body is operating appropriately i know that that was a lot of words but let me know what questions do you have about your care and your treatment\r\n[patient] how much are all these tests going to cost\r\n[doctor] they are going to be free ninety nine because your mom is paying for them\r\n[patient] okay that's that's good to know\r\n[doctor] yes\r\n[patient] and when do i when do i have to do those tests\r\n[doctor] i would prefer you to get them done as soon as possible so when you walk out of this room there is a a blood lab right next door i need you to go ahead and do some of those draws some of them i will need you to not have eaten we are gon na do them it's called fasting and you can make sure that you have n't eaten when you do but they will the lab techs will know so you will be able to knock out most of those today\r\n[patient] okay and i'm not sure i will be able to do that today because i have a class right after this\r\n[doctor] mm-hmm\r\n[patient] and right after that i have to go to work\r\n[doctor] mm-hmm\r\n[patient] you know if i told you i'm about changing jobs did i\r\n[doctor] no you did n't mention that but one of the cool things about being a doctor is i can write you a note so you're gon na do it and then you can go to the class and we could figure it but like it's really cool that you're changing jobs i'm happy for you i hope you know that like it's always great to be able to make some income and make some

He reports increased nocturnal urination and a history of recurrent sore throats, with four episodes in the last five months. Michael denies changes in appetite, fatigue, or recent sports participation. He mentions a smoking brother at home and frequent exposure to illness due to COVID-19. His academic performance is good, but he expresses frustration with his physics teacher's attire.\n\nVITALS\nNot provided in the transcript.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n- General: No apparent distress.\n- Throat: Tonsils midline, no erythema or swelling.\n- Neck: No cervical adenopathy.\n- Lungs: Clear to auscultation, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.\n- Heart: Normal rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.\n- Back: No tenderness on palpation.\n- Abdomen: No rebound, guarding, or tenderness.\n\nRESULTS\nPending laboratory results include a lipid panel, urinalysis (UA), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), complete blood count (CBC), vitamin D, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). A CT scan showed signs suggestive of glomerulonephritis.\n\nASSESSMENT\nSuspected glomerulonephritis secondary to recurrent streptococcal infections, indicated by the CT findings and history of frequent sore throats. Consideration for tonsillectomy to reduce streptococcal infections. No immediate evidence of other systemic issues based on physical exam and initial labs.\n\nPLAN\nRefer to nephrology for evaluation of glomerulonephritis. Refer to ENT for evaluation of recurrent strep and potential tonsillectomy. Order pending labs to assess overall health and nutritional status. Schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to review lab results and discuss further management. Provide a note for missed class and work due to medical appointments.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nComplete any necessary lab tests immediately upon discharge, ensuring fasting for certain tests. Attend scheduled follow-up appointment in one week. Avoid strenuous activity until further notice. Maintain hydration and monitor symptoms. If symptoms worsen or new symptoms appear, seek immediate medical attention.",

what what started what happened why do you think you are here\r\n[patient] hi doctor how are you\r\n[doctor] hi i'm great thanks for asking\r\n[patient] well so yeah i just happened to have gone in for my regular visit and i just explained to my pcp that you know what i've been having some back pain it's usually on the left and you know he asked some questions and he said i should come see you\r\n[doctor] alright yeah back pain especially like that like was it sharp could you tell me what kind of pain it was\r\n[patient] well yeah some days it was sharp some days it was n't some days it moves some days it does n't but it's mostly on the left\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] that's\r\n[doctor] alright\r\n[patient] yeah\r\n[doctor] unloving the spectrum that we have right here let's see if we can dig down and get some details well a couple of things i wan na ask have you been a bit more tired than lately\r\n[patient] no not recall\r\n[doctor] alright how about your appetite are you hungry or or not as hungry\r\n[patient] i i would say about his that that's pretty much unchanged\r\n[doctor] okay your appetite is unchanged alright what about your water consumption\r\n[patient] that i'm sorry what did you say\r\n[doctor] no it's fine how about your water consumption\r\n[patient] yes but i've been drinking a lot more water and i do realize that i i wake up sometimes during the night to you know use the restroom to pee more than i normally do\r\n[doctor] okay so we have noticed an increase in urine output okay how do you have like any normal activities are you playing any sports\r\n[patient] yeah i ride i ride a bike every so often\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] so good yeah\r\n[doctor] okay and are you like watching any other sports like did you watch march madness\r\n[patient] no sorry\r\n[doctor] be still my heart okay that's fine i'll forgive you so\r\n[patient] thank you\r\n[doctor] okay but how is school like are you like are are things going well like are you enjoying like your your time there\r\n[patient] yeah school is actually going well gotten good grades\r\n[doctor] nice\r\n[patient] although my my physics teachers socks cheese\r\n[doctor] they usually do anybody who chooses to engage in physics for the rest of their life i question their choices it's fine okay but are you when you're like while you are at school like has anybody been sick i know like with you know covid has been going around but like have you noticed anybody like that sick all the time around you\r\n[patient] sick all the time everybody is sick these days\r\n[doctor] alright\r\n[patient] so\r\n[doctor] but what about at home how about your siblings are any of them sick\r\n[patient] most of them are healthy yeah most of them are healthy although you know i have a brother who smokes i have told him not to smoke he does n't listen\r\n[doctor] mm-hmm\r\n[patient] house told not to smoke at the house but you know anyway\r\n[doctor] okay so there is a smoker at home you know that does that does affect you so we might have to have a conversation with your brother and anybody else but it's good to know that people are n't sick i do see here though that you have kind of a a history of recurrent strep like you you seem to be having these sore throats a lot i think it says that you've had four in the last five months is that correct\r\n[patient] yeah strep and bfs i'm not quite sure what it is just seems to come on you know i get this sore throat and fibroid i'm told i have strep\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] sometimes you know my doctor knows what he is doing strep everyday strep everyday but anyway if he says i have strep then i have strep\r\n[doctor] i okay i respect that and i'm glad that you you listen to him at the end of the day that's always a good thing alright so now that we've gotten like kind of a lot of the history out of the way i do want to do my physical exam is that okay\r\n[patient] sure\r\n[doctor] alright so when i look in your throat like i'm not noticing any erythema no swelling your tonsils are midline so those look good when i'm feeling here on your neck i'm not appreciating any like lymphadenopathy no cervical adenopathy and like i wan na check those things because i just wan na make sure i'm not seeing any physical signs of like any kind of strep right now right i do n't want i wan na make sure you're not having an infection when i listen to your lungs i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales rhonchi that means i'm not hearing funky sounds your heart sounds great no murmur no rub no gallop when i press on your back remember you told me you had that left back pain when i press on it does it hurt\r\n[patient] no\r\n[doctor] okay alright great no tenderness on palpation when i press on your abdomen are you feeling any pain\r\n[patient] no\r\n[doctor] alright no rebound no guarding that's great okay so based on my physical exam we are gon na have a couple conversations one that ct that your your primary care doctor the the one that you you question his judgment it is showing a couple things that we are a little concerned about it could be that these recurrent strep episodes that you've been having it looks like they are like potentially that they are caused something called glomerulonephritis right there's just some some swelling here and we have to be careful of something like that because it could lead to like kidney disease chronic kidney disease and we wan na make sure that we cut that off right so the first thing is i'm gon na refer you for your problem of glomerulonephritis i'm gon na refer you to an ent i want them to look at you and maybe consider taking out your tonsils to see if that could help with some of the recurrent strep though that you're feeling but i would like to leave that to them to make that decision for you and me we're gon na do some more like confirmations right i'm gon na order some labs i want several a lipid panel a ua a cmp a cbc a vitamin d and a tsh all of these things will give me more information about kind of like what's happening in your body right now in terms of like your hormones and you know your iron levels and to make sure that you are like getting all the nutrition that you need and that your body is operating appropriately i know that that was a lot of words but let me know what questions do you have about your care and your treatment\r\n[patient] how much are all these tests going to cost\r\n[doctor] they are going to be free ninety nine because your mom is paying for them\r\n[patient] okay that's that's good to know\r\n[doctor] yes\r\n[patient] and when do i when do i have to do those tests\r\n[doctor] i would prefer you to get them done as soon as possible so when you walk out of this room there is a a blood lab right next door i need you to go ahead and do some of those draws some of them i will need you to not have eaten we are gon na do them it's called fasting and you can make sure that you have n't eaten when you do but they will the lab techs will know so you will be able to knock out most of those today\r\n[patient] okay and i'm not sure i will be able to do that today because i have a class right after this\r\n[doctor] mm-hmm\r\n[patient] and right after that i have to go to work\r\n[doctor] mm-hmm\r\n[patient] you know if i told you i'm about changing jobs did i\r\n[doctor] no you did n't mention that but one of the cool things about being a doctor is i can write you a note so you're gon na do it and then you can go to the class and we could figure it but like it's really cool that you're changing jobs i'm happy for you i hope you know that like it's always great to be able to make some income and make some decisions that means that you'll be able to start paying for your test soon uh\r\n[patient] well yeah this new job there is no insurance and my old boss sucks so i'm hoping i'll get a new boss and you know hopefully some free food with with this ut because it's had a restaurant so we'll we'll see how that goes\r\n[doctor] we might have to have a conversation about the free food at the restaurant if we do n't get some of these infections under control because your salt intake is about to be very important okay\r\n[patient] got it\r\n[doctor] alright okay so do you have any more questions before i send my nurse in\r\n[patient] do i need to get a shot today\r\n[doctor] no shots today just stopped\r\n[patient] okay and when do i have to come back for the results\r\n[doctor] i need you to come

back\r\n[patient] excellent\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] thank you very much\r\n[doctor] no problem",

today\r\n[patient] good to see you mister edwards i'm doctor\r\n[doctor] tell me what's been going on yeah so i've got this stabbing shooting pain i've had for a while you know and it it especially right here in my right face right in that cheek bone area it's sometimes it gets super hot i've had it for i think a couple of months now and i went to my family doctor and they said i should come see you\r\n[patient] okay great i would like to ask you a little bit more about that\r\n[doctor] had in your face do you remember how long that you had it probably for about two or three months just just came on slowly i started noticing it but now it's i have episodes where just shooting stabbing kind of a pain in my right cheek bone right face area\r\n[patient] mm-hmm do you have any sensory loss meaning like numbness or tingling in that part of your face\r\n[doctor] not that i've noticed no okay do you have any symptoms like this anywhere else on your face including the other side of your face\r\n[patient] no it's just on the right side mostly not on the left side just on the right side of my face\r\n[doctor] have you noticed any weakness on that side of the face like when you smile or while you're doing other things any weakness there not really i mean i've i've i've tried to you know when i smile my smile seems equal on both sides my eyes i do n't have any weakness there my vision seems to be unchanged but just this stabbing severe pain it's just like excruciating pain that i get sometimes does it happen on its own or there are certain things that trigger it\r\n[patient] sometimes if i'm if certain temperatures seem to trigger it sometimes or if it's super where it's cold i get a trigger sometimes\r\n[doctor] sometimes certain kind of sensory outside of the wind sometimes that seems to trigger it but that's about it\r\n[patient] okay and anything that you've done to to that helps for a little bit when you\r\n[doctor] pain excess\r\n[patient] you know i've tried ibuprofen and motrin that had really has n't helped it just comes on suddenly and then it's kinda stabbing excruciating pain i've tried rubbing some you know some tiger balm on it that did n't work\r\n[doctor] but that's you know so i i went to my family doctor and he said you know i really need to see a neurosurgeon\r\n[patient] got it how long do these episodes last these pain\r\n[doctor] you know it can last for anywhere from a few minutes to sometimes about an hour but generally generally a few minutes\r\n[patient] any history of something like multiple sclerosis or any brain tumors that you know\r\n[doctor] no nothing like that alright any other kinda headache symptoms that have anything like you had migraines or anything related to the headaches i mean i get occasional headaches but not really i do n't have a history of migraines but i occasionally get headaches like everybody else i take some tylenol that usually goes away but this is different\r\n[patient] how severe is the pain on a scale of one to ten\r\n[doctor] when it comes on it's like a ten it's like somebody is stabbing you with an ice pick and but usually you know after a few minutes usually it goes away but sometimes it can last up to an hour great so mister i would like to do a physical exam if that's okay with you\r\n[patient] sure\r\n[doctor] i would like you to follow my finger here and i see that you're following my finger in in both directions can you show me your teeth\r\n[patient] that looks nice and symmetric i'm gon na rub my fingers next to your ear can you hear that\r\n[doctor] yep\r\n[patient] you can hear it on the other side as well\r\n[doctor] yep\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] i'm gon na take this cotton tape and run it along the side of your face can you feel that okay\r\n[patient] yeah it's a little bit numb on my right side not so much on my left side\r\n[doctor] okay alright i'm gon na use this little needle here and i'm gon na poke here and i wan na see if you feel like it's being sharp or dull on that part of your face does that feel different or normal\r\n[patient] it feels a little bit dull on my left on my right side my left side it feels sharp\r\n[doctor] alright good well i had a chance to look at your mri\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] and i looked at your mri and it appears to have small blood vessel that is abutting and perhaps even pinching the trigeminal nerve the trigeminal nerve is nerve that comes from the brainstem that goes out to the face and provides the sensory inflammation from the face and you may have a condition called trigeminal neuralgia\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] where the nerve compression causes this kind of shooting electrical pain in the face how do we treat it\r\n[patient] well the first line would be to try some medications usually we start with medications that are called gabapentin\r\n[doctor] or tegretol these are medications that really help reduce the excitability of the nerve\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] most people can get the pain control with that but there are some people where the medications are n't gon na be enough and in that situation we would consider surgery i would n't i would n't recommend that now we usually try the medications first\r\n[patient] for considering a surgery to decompress the nerve the root cause of the problem is the compression of the blood vessel against the nerve\r\n[doctor] okay so we should be tried which one would you recommend the tegretol or yeah i think we could start with the tegretol to start with i just want to make sure that you understand some of the potential side effects that you can have with this\r\n[patient] sure\r\n[doctor] it's always a little bit of trial and error to figure out what the right dosing that would work for you but some common side effects can include you know memory loss tingling imbalance some people can actually have like dermatologic\r\n[patient] skin reaction to this medication and particularly people who have eustachian descent so that we may do some genetic testing just to make sure that it will be safe for you\r\n[doctor] okay sounds good let's do it\r\n[patient] okay so i will prescribe that for you and then we will see how that goes and if your pain continues we can talk about different surgical options to treat the pain\r\n[doctor] yeah i think i would like to try the tegretol first and if that does n't work then i can come back and so once should i come back and just to kinda check back with you and see if you know if it's had enough time for a fact or not\r\n[patient] i think one month would be a great time to follow up\r\n[doctor] okay sounds good so if you want to send that prescription over to my pharmacy that would be fine and then why do n't i come back in about a month and we'll go from there\r\n[patient] great i'll see you then\r\n[doctor] alright\n\n    SUMMARY:\n    Please generate a medical summary based on the

to my family doctor and he said you know i really need to see a neurosurgeon\r\n[patient] got it how long do these episodes last these pain\r\n[doctor] you know it can last for anywhere from a few minutes to sometimes about an hour but generally generally a few minutes\r\n[patient] any history of something like multiple sclerosis or any brain tumors that you know\r\n[doctor] no nothing like that alright any other kinda headache symptoms that have anything like you had migraines or anything related to the headaches i mean i get occasional headaches but not really i do n't have a history of migraines but i occasionally get headaches like everybody else i take some tylenol that usually goes away but this is different\r\n[patient] how severe is the pain on a scale of one to ten\r\n[doctor] when it comes on it's like a ten it's like somebody is stabbing you with an ice pick and but usually you know after a few minutes usually it goes away but sometimes it can last up to an hour great so mister i would like to do a physical exam if that's okay with you\r\n[patient] sure\r\n[doctor] i would like you to follow my finger here and i see that you're following my finger in in both directions can you show me your teeth\r\n[patient] that looks nice and symmetric i'm gon na rub my fingers next to your ear can you hear that\r\n[doctor] yep\r\n[patient] you can hear it on the other side as well\r\n[doctor] yep\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] i'm gon na take this cotton tape and run it along the side of your face can you feel that okay\r\n[patient] yeah it's a little bit numb on my right side not so much on my left side\r\n[doctor] okay alright i'm gon na use this little needle here and i'm gon na poke here and i wan na see if you feel like it's being sharp or dull on that part of your face does that feel different or normal\r\n[patient] it feels a little bit dull on my left on my right side my left side it feels sharp\r\n[doctor] alright good well i had a chance to look at your mri\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] and i looked at your mri and it appears to have small blood vessel that is abutting and perhaps even pinching the trigeminal nerve the trigeminal nerve is nerve that comes from the brainstem that goes out to the face and provides the sensory inflammation from the face and you may have a condition called trigeminal neuralgia\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] where the nerve compression causes this kind of shooting electrical pain in the face how do we treat it\r\n[patient] well the first line would be to try some medications usually we start with medications that are called gabapentin\r\n[doctor] or tegretol these are medications that really help reduce the excitability of the nerve\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] most people can get the pain control with that but there are some people where the medications are n't gon na be enough and in that situation we would consider surgery i would n't i would n't recommend that now we usually try the medications first\r\n[patient] for considering a surgery to decompress the nerve the root cause of the problem is the compression of the blood vessel against the nerve\r\n[doctor] okay so we should be tried which one would you recommend the tegretol or yeah i think we could start with the tegretol to start with i just want to make sure that you understand some of the potential side effects that you can have with this\r\n[patient] sure\r\n[doctor] it's always a little bit of trial and error to figure out what the right dosing that would work for you but some common side effects can include you know memory loss tingling imbalance some people can actually have like dermatologic\r\n[patient] skin reaction to this medication and particularly people who have eustachian descent so that we may do some genetic testing just to make sure that it will be safe for you\r\n[doctor] okay sounds good let's do it\r\n[patient] okay so i will prescribe that for you and then we will see how that goes and if your pain continues we can talk about different surgical options to treat the pain\r\n[doctor] yeah i think i would like to try the tegretol first and if that does n't work then i can come back and so once should i come back and just to kinda check back with you and see if you know if it's had enough time for a fact or not\r\n[patient] i think one month would be a great time to follow up\r\n[doctor] okay sounds good so if you want to send that prescription over to my pharmacy that would be fine and then why do n't i come back in about a month and we'll go from there\r\n[patient] great i'll see you then\r\n[doctor] alright",
    "reference": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\r\n\r\nRight-sided facial pain.\r\n\r\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\r\n\r\nEyes: Denies vision changes or weakness in right eye.\r\nHENT: Reports right sided facial pain. Denies left sided facial pain. Neurological: Reports headaches. Denies sensory loss, numbness, or tingling in the right cheek. Denies right sided facial weakness.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL EXAM\r\n\r\nNeurological\r\n- Orientation: Light touch testing of the right side of the face reveals numbness when compared to the contralateral side. Pinprick testing is sharp on the left side of the face; dull on the right side of the face.\r\n\r\nEars, Nose, Mouth, and Throat\r\nBilateral finger rub test is negative.\r\n- Examination of Mouth: Teeth are symmetric.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nMRI of the head is reviewed today. This demonstrates a small blood vessel that is abutting, and perhaps even pinching, the right trigeminal nerve.\r\n\r\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\r\n\r\n1. Trigeminal neuralgia.\r\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient has been experiencing facial pain for 2 to 3 months. A recent MRI revealed a small blood vessel abutting, or perhaps even pinching, the right trigeminal nerve. The root cause of his facial pain is the compression of the blood vessel against this nerve.\r\n- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed treatment options including medicating with gabapentin or Tegretol. I explained the common side effects associated with these medications can include memory loss, tingling, and imbalance. We discussed the need for genetic testing due to the possible side effect of dermatologic reactions in people of East Asian descent. We also briefly discussed surgical treatment to decompress the nerve, but this is not recommended at this time.\r\n- Medical Treatment: A prescription for Tegretol will be sent to the patient’s pharmacy.\r\n\r\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nThe patient will follow up with me in 1 month. If at that time his facial pain persists, we may further discuss surgical options."

hand . he had a hyperextension injury of that index finger during a motor vehicle accident in march of this year . he was offered an injection of the a1 polyregion , but did not want any steroid because of the reaction to dexamethasone , which causes his heart to race . he was scheduled to see dr. alice davis , which it does n't appear he did . he had an mri of that finger , because there was concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of , quote , \" fds tendon , \" end quote . he has been seen at point may orthopedics largely by the physical therapy staff and a pr , pa at that institution .\r\n[doctor] at that practice , an mri was obtained on 4/24/2021 , which showed just focal soft tissue swelling over the right index mcp joint , partial-thickness tear of the right fds , and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the fdp and fds tendons . radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index mcp joint were intact , as the mcp joint capsule . extensor tendons also deemed intact .\r\n[doctor] his x-rays , four views of the right hand today , show no bony abnormalities , joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand , no soft tissue shadows of concern , no arthritis . hi , how are you , mr . gutierrez ?\r\n[patient] i'm good , how about you ?\r\n[doctor] well , how can i help you today ?\r\n[patient] so i was a passenger in , uh , a car that was rear-ended , and we were hit multiple times . i felt two bumps , which slung me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger .\r\n[doctor] so hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards ?\r\n[patient] um , i do n't really know . i just felt , like , it felt like i laid on my finger , and so , i felt like it went back , and it's been hurting since about march . and it's been like that ever , ever since the wreck happened . so i , and i ca n't make a fist , but sometimes the pain's unbearable . and , like , even driving hurts .\r\n[doctor] okay , so this was march of this year , so maybe about three months ago ?\r\n[patient] yeah , and it's still swollen . so i was seeing , uh , an orthopedist , and they sent me to an occupational therapist . and i've been doing therapy with them , and then they sent me to go back and get an mri . so i went and got the mri . uh , then they told me that the mri came back , and it said i had a tear in my finger , but he was n't gon na give me an injection , because the injection was going to make the tear worse .\r\n[doctor] mm-hmm .\r\n[patient] and then , after he got the mri , he said that i have , uh , a tear in my finger , and that he did n't wan na do surgery , but he would do an injection . then i'm thinking that you told me you would n't do an injection in there , and then the oper- , occupational therapy says it's because of the tear . and then , they do n't want me to keep rubbing the thing , and doing things with my hand . so i feel like i'm not getting medical care , really .\r\n[doctor] yeah , i see that .\r\n[patient] so i came to see if you could do anything for this hand , because i am right-handed , and i kinda need that hand .\r\n[doctor] what do you do for a living ?\r\n[patient] uh , i'm an x-ray tech .\r\n[doctor] well , um , so do you have any diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis ?\r\n[patient] nope .\r\n[doctor] uh , do you take any chronic medications of su- , significance ?\r\n[patient] uh , i do take a blood pressure pill , and that's it .\r\n[doctor] okay , and it looks like you suffer from itching with the methylprednisolone ?\r\n[patient] uh , that's correct .\r\n[doctor] all right , well , i'm gon na scoot up closer and just take a quick look at your hand . all right , so , lean over here . all right , so on this exam today , we have a very pleasant , cooperative , healthy male , no distress . his heart rate is regular rate , rhythm , 2+ radial pulse , no swelling or bruise , bruising in the palm over the volar surface of his index finger , normal creases , slightly diminished over the pip of the index finger compared to the middle finger .\r\n[doctor] his index finger rests in a 10-degree pip-flexed , uh , position . all right , is that uncomfortable to correct that , and is it uncomfortable now here ?\r\n[patient] yeah , uh , when you push on it , yeah .\r\n[doctor] all right , how about here ?\r\n[patient] um , there , it's not .\r\n[doctor] okay , not as bad ?\r\n[patient] yeah , it feels , uh , a little numb .\r\n[doctor] gotcha , all right . bend , bend the tip of this finger . bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . keep bending . all right , straighten it out . all right , and now , bend it for me as best you can .\r\n[patient] my goodness . it feels like it's , it's tearing in there .\r\n[doctor] okay , okay . well , bend the tip of this finger , and bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . all right , straighten that out , and now , bend it for me as best you can . all right , good . now , bend that finger , and i'm going to pull , put it down like this . and then bend that finger for me . okay , sorry , can you bend it for me ? all right . now , make a fist . great , so relax the finger . all right , so just keep it , keep , when i bend the finger , we're just going to bend that finger where it meets the hand . is that okay there ?\r\n[patient] ow , .\r\n[doctor] okay , okay . so all the hurt , it seems , is stretching , because you have n't been doing this for so long . so , you know what i mean ? so , um , you're going to have to start really doing that .\r\n[patient] well , i've tried . i even bought myself a splint .\r\n[doctor] well , but a splint does n't help move you . it actually immobilizes you .\r\n[patient] okay . i thought it would straighten it out .\r\n[doctor] no , no . so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me , as hard as you can , and keep going , going . all right , so , so you're okay . all right , so i would say the following , that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds , and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds , the flexor digitorum superficialis , which is the least important of the two .\r\n[patient] okay .\r\n[doctor] uh , now , there's two halves of it . so it's a partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important , and the other one is just fine .\r\n[patient] so the good one is good ?\r\n[doctor] yes , correct . so the one that goes all the way to the tip is good .\r\n[patient] okay , good .\r\n[doctor] yeah , so you know , i think what you have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the fds tendon blocking excursion of these other tendons , that they ca n't get through to the pulley .\r\n[patient] okay , all right .\r\n[doctor] so what i would recommend what we try is a cortisone injection , and i would avoid the dexamethasone , because i saw you have a little reaction to that . but we could use the betamethasone , which is a celestone .\r\n[patient] i've gotten another , uh , methylprednisolone , and that itched me like crazy .\r\n[doctor] did it ? yeah , this one is water-soluble , and i think it's fairly low toxicity , but high benefit , and i think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that finger .\r\n[patient] all right , we'll give it a try .\r\n[doctor] good . so , you do the shot , and it's going to take about three to five days before it starts feeling better . and then probably over the next couple of weeks , it'll start feeling even better .\r\n[patient] perfect .\r\n[doctor] all right , so take advantage of that . you've got ta start moving the finger . you're not going to tear anything or break a bone , uh , because your intensors , extensors are intact . but your collateral ligaments are intact , so you've got a stiff , sore finger . i'm going to try to help as much as i can with this soreness part , and then you have to do all the stiff part .\r\n[patient] the lady in occupational therapy tried some maneuvers to straighten the finger out , but it even hurt after i left . the whole thing just swelled up .\r\n[doctor] hmm . okay , so it was injured , and you had scar tissue . and then , you had post-traumatic inflammation . and so , this will help some with all of that . it's not going to make it to where your finger is like , , my finger does n't hurt at all , but it will make it to where at least tolerable , to where you can make some gains . and we actually might need to repeat this as well .\r\n[patient] will i be able to drive ? i drove myself here today , so ...\r\n[doctor] yeah , it may feel a little weird , but it's totally safe for you to drive .\r\n[patient] okay , good .\r\n[doctor] so for mr . gutierrez , just put that he has a post-traumatic rather severe stenosing tenosynovitis of his right index finger , and the plan is steroid injection today , do a trigger injection , but i'm using a cc of betamethasone . so , mr . gutierrez , do you have , um , therapy scheduled or set up ?\r\n[patient] uh , not at the moment .\r\n[doctor] all right , well , i mean , you know that you need to move that finger , and i think to the degree that they can help you do that . so i want you to move that finger , finger , but i think it would be , uh , beneficial for you to have an accountability , um , so at least you know to check in with them once a week with somebody .\r\n[patient] um , okay . that's kinda why i'm here , for you to tell me what needs to be done , you know ?\r\n[doctor] yeah , so i'll write you out , um , an outpatient prescription . i think if you go back to the same people where you were before , i'm hoping that after this injection , you're going to be able to do a whole lot more with them . so let's do outpatient once a week for six weeks , um , and then full active and passive range of motion is the goal with no restrictions .\r\n[patient] all right , sounds like a plan .\r\n[doctor] all right , well , i will have the nurse set up the injection procedure , and we'll , and i'll be back shortly .\r\n[patient] thanks , doc .\r\n[doctor] right trigger finger injection template . attempted to inject one cc of celestone with f- , a half a cc of lidocaine . however , the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle , with contortions of the hand , and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick . needle was withdrawn . the patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath . we attempted a second time for a similar injection using the same technique with one cc of celestone and half a cc of lidocaine . a small parma- , uh , palmar vein bled a scant amount , which was cleaned up and band-aid applied . reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger .

    "source": "[doctor] this is philip gutierrez , date of birth 1/12/71 . he is a 50-year-old male here for a second opinion regarding the index finger on the right hand . he had a hyperextension injury of that index finger during a motor vehicle accident in march of this year . he was offered an injection of the a1 polyregion , but did not want any steroid because of the reaction to dexamethasone , which causes his heart to race . he was scheduled to see dr. alice davis , which it does n't appear he did . he had an mri of that finger , because there was concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of , quote , \" fds tendon , \" end quote . he has been seen at point may orthopedics largely by the physical therapy staff and a pr , pa at that institution .\r\n[doctor] at that practice , an mri was obtained on 4/24/2021 , which showed just focal soft tissue swelling over the right index mcp joint , partial-thickness tear of the right fds , and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the fdp and fds tendons . radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index mcp joint were intact , as the mcp joint capsule . extensor tendons also deemed intact .\r\n[doctor] his x-rays , four views of the right hand today , show no bony abnormalities , joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand , no soft tissue shadows of concern , no arthritis . hi , how are you , mr . gutierrez ?\r\n[patient] i'm good , how about you ?\r\n[doctor] well , how can i help you today ?\r\n[patient] so i was a passenger in , uh , a car that was rear-ended , and we were hit multiple times . i felt two bumps , which slung me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger .\r\n[doctor] so hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards ?\r\n[patient] um , i do n't really know . i just felt , like , it felt like i laid on my finger , and so , i felt like it went back , and it's been hurting since about march . and it's been like that ever , ever since the wreck happened . so i , and i ca n't make a fist , but sometimes the pain's unbearable . and , like , even driving hurts .\r\n[doctor] okay , so this was march of this year , so maybe about three months ago ?\r\n[patient] yeah , and it's still swollen . so i was seeing , uh , an orthopedist , and they sent me to an occupational therapist . and i've been doing therapy with them , and then they sent me to go back and get an mri . so i went and got the mri . uh , then they told me that the mri came back , and it said i had a tear in my finger , but he was n't gon na give me an injection , because the injection was going to make the tear worse .\r\n[doctor] mm-hmm .\r\n[patient] and then , after he got the mri , he said that i have , uh , a tear in my finger , and that he did n't wan na do surgery , but he would do an injection . then i'm thinking that you told me you would n't do an injection in there , and then the oper- , occupational therapy says it's because of the tear . and then , they do n't want me to keep rubbing the thing , and doing things with my hand . so i feel like i'm not getting medical care , really .\r\n[doctor] yeah , i see that .\r\n[patient] so i came to see if you could do anything for this hand , because i am right-handed , and i kinda need that hand .\r\n[doctor] what do you do for a living ?\r\n[patient] uh , i'm an x-ray tech .\r\n[doctor] well , um , so do you have any diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis ?\r\n[patient] nope .\r\n[doctor] uh , do you take any chronic medications of su- , significance ?\r\n[patient] uh , i do take a blood pressure pill , and that's it .\r\n[doctor] okay , and it looks like you suffer from itching with the methylprednisolone ?\r\n[patient] uh , that's correct .\r\n[doctor] all right , well , i'm gon na scoot up closer and just take a quick look at your hand . all right , so , lean over here . all right , so on this exam today , we have a very pleasant , cooperative , healthy male , no distress . his heart rate is regular rate , rhythm , 2+ radial pulse , no swelling or bruise , bruising in the palm over the volar surface of his index finger , normal creases , slightly diminished over the pip of the index finger compared to the middle finger .\r\n[doctor] his index finger rests in a 10-degree pip-flexed , uh , position . all right , is that uncomfortable to correct that , and is it uncomfortable now here ?\r\n[patient] yeah , uh , when you push on it , yeah .\r\n[doctor] all right , how about here ?\r\n[patient] um , there , it's not .\r\n[doctor] okay , not as bad ?\r\n[patient] yeah , it feels , uh , a little numb .\r\n[doctor] gotcha , all right . bend , bend the tip of this finger . bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . keep bending . all right , straighten it out . all right , and now , bend it for me as best you can .\r\n[patient] my goodness . it feels like it's , it's tearing in there .\r\n[doctor] okay , okay . well , bend the tip of this finger , and bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . all right , straighten that out , and now , bend it for me as best you can . all right , good . now , bend that finger , and i'm going to pull , put it down like this . and then bend that finger for me . okay , sorry , can you bend it for me ? all right . now , make a fist . great , so relax the finger . all right , so just keep it , keep , when i bend the finger , we're just going to bend that finger where it meets the hand . is that okay there ?\r\n[patient] ow , .\r\n[doctor] okay , okay . so all the hurt , it seems , is stretching , because you have n't been doing this for so long . so , you know what i mean ? so , um , you're going to have to start really doing that .\r\n[patient] well , i've tried . i even bought myself a splint .\r\n[doctor] well , but a splint does n't help move you . it actually immobilizes you .\r\n[patient] okay . i thought it would straighten it out .\r\n[doctor] no , no . so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me , as hard as you can , and keep going , going . all right , so , so you're okay . all right , so i would say the following , that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds , and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds , the flexor digitorum superficialis , which is the least important of the two .\r\n[patient] okay .\r\n[doctor] uh , now , there's two halves of it . so it's a partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important , and the other one is just fine .\r\n[patient] so the good one is good ?\r\n[doctor] yes , correct . so the one that goes all the way to the tip is good .\r\n[patient] okay , good .\r\n[doctor] yeah , so you know , i think what you have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the fds tendon blocking excursion of these other tendons , that they ca n't get through to the pulley .\r\n[patient] okay , all right .\r\n[doctor] so what i would recommend what we try is a cortisone injection , and i would avoid the dexamethasone , because i saw you have a little reaction to that . but we could use the betamethasone , which is a celestone .\r\n[patient] i've gotten another , uh , methylprednisolone , and that itched me like crazy .\r\n[doctor] did it ? yeah , this one is water-soluble , and i think it's fairly low toxicity , but high benefit , and i think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that finger .\r\n[patient] all right , we'll give it a try .\r\n[doctor] good . so , you do the shot , and it's going to take about three to five days before it starts feeling better . and then probably over the next couple of weeks , it'll start feeling even better .\r\n[patient]

    "reference": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\r\n\r\nRight index finger hyperextension injury.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\r\n\r\nMs. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion regarding evaluation of the right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in 03/2021.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the patient was the passenger in a vehicle that was rear-ended. He reports they were hit multiple times as he felt 2 bumps which caused his to sling forward hyperextending his right index finger. He was offered an injection of the A1 pulley region, but he did not want any steroid due to a reaction to dexamethasone that causes his heart to race. The patient was scheduled to see Dr. Alice Davis, but he has not seen his yet. The patient has been seen at Point May Orthopedics, by the physical therapy staff and a physician assistant at that practice. He underwent an MRI of the right index finger because they were concerned about a capsular strain plus or minus a rupture of the \"FDS tendon.\"\r\n\r\nThe patient states that he is unable to make a fist secondary to pain and swelling in the right index finger. He describes a pulling, tearing sensation in the right index finger. The pain is exacerbated by driving. He notes that he has been wearing a right index finger splint.\r\n\r\nThe patient denies any history of diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. He reports only taking medication for hypertension and denies taking any other chronic medications of significance. He also notes methylprednisolone causes his to itch.\r\n\r\nMs. Gutierrez is employed as an x-ray technician.\r\n\r\nPAST HISTORY\r\n\r\nMedical\r\nHypertension.\r\n\r\nSOCIAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nEmployed as x-ray technician.\r\n\r\nALLERGIES\r\n\r\nMethylprednisolone causes itching.\r\nDexamethasone causes palpitations.\r\n\r\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\r\n\r\n• Musculoskeletal: Right index finger pain.\r\n• Endocrine: Denies diabetes.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL EXAM\r\n\r\nConstitutional\r\nVery pleasant, healthy appearing, cooperative male in no distress.\r\n\r\nNeurological\r\nGrossly intact. Slightly diminished sensation to light touch over the right PIP joint of the index finger compared to the middle finger.\r\n\r\nCardiovascular\r\nRegular rate and rhythm.\r\n\r\nMusculoskeletal\r\nExam of the right hand, there is no swelling or ecchymosis in the palm on the volar surface of his index finger. Normal creases are noted. Index finger rests in a 10 degree PIP joint flexed position with discomfort upon correction. Bilateral extremities 2+ radial pulses.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nX-rays today, 4 views of the right hand, show no bony abnormalities. Joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand. No soft tissue shadows of concern. No arthritis.\r\n\r\nMRI of the right index finger performed on 04/24/2021. Independent review of the images shows focal soft tissue swelling over the right index MCP joint, partial-thickness tear of the right FDS, and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the FDP and FDS tendons. Radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index MCP joint were intact as was the MCP joint capsule. The extensor tendons were also deemed intact.\r\n\r\nASSESSMENT\r\n\r\n• Stenosing tenosynovitis of right index finger.\r\n\r\nMs. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion of his right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in March of this year. The findings of his examination are consistent with rather severe post-traumatic stenosing tenosynovitis.\r\n\r\nPLAN\r\n\r\nThe patient and I had a lengthy discussion regarding his history, symptoms, and radiographic findings. We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of stenosing tenosynovitis and the anatomy of the flexor tendons and pulley system in the hand. I explained to the patient that the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon was clearly intact and that He is suffering from post-traumatic inflammation around the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon blocking excursion of the flexor tendons to the A1 pulley.\r\n\r\nTreatment options were discussed including conservative management with corticosteroid injections and their statistical effectiveness. Surgical correction was also briefly discussed, although I recommend exhausting non-operative measures with a minimum of 2 injections before proceeding with surgery. I recommended a right index trigger finger cortisone injection today, and the patient elected to proceed. I also recommend that the patient report to occupational therapy once a week for the next 6 weeks to work on full active and passive right index finger range of motion with no restrictions.\r\n\r\nThe patient verbalizes understanding with the treatment plan and agrees. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction today.\r\n\r\nPROCEDURE\r\n\r\nRight index trigger finger injection.\r\nThe patient understands the risks and benefits and elected to proceed, signed consent obtained. An attempt was made to inject 1.0 cc of Celestone with 0.5 cc of lidocaine. However, the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle with contortions of the hand and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick. Therefore, the needle was withdrawn. The patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath. We attempted a 2nd time for a similar injection using the same technique with 1.0 cc of Celestone and 0.5 cc of lidocaine. There was a small palmar vein that bled a scant amount, which was cleaned up off the back of the patient's hand. A Band-Aid was applied. He was reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger. I recommended icing it this evening and taking ibuprofen.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nOccupational therapy as prescribed.\r\n"

intro anymore i was just going with that you you're coming in with sudden visual distortion and blurring of vision so i'll just you know i'll just say i'll just go ahead and go into this technician part so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines and your door frames have been looking crooked to you is that right\r\n[patient] it is yes\r\n[doctor] okay what kind of venture are we gon na go into do you do you have the the script or no it it just talks\r\n[patient] but it's it's not presenting like like how you're reading it like how you're talking about it is it kinda what i'm saying because like after that i'm supposed to say yeah whenever i take my husband out to like a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights but i'm not really getting the question of like so what's causing it or where do you have this happening stuff like that so i'm a little confused\r\n[doctor] okay i mean i can just straight out follow the script just so we can kinda get it rolling so so i said so hi so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines in your door frames have been looking crooked to you\r\n[patient] yeah and whenever i take my husband out to a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights\r\n[doctor] uh okay so do you have a favorite restaurant you like to go to\r\n[patient] i do mcdonalds is one of my favorite here in arlington\r\n[doctor] that sounds good what what do you what's your favorite there\r\n[patient] they have a great egg plant parmajon one of my favorite so i just go ahead and go with that\r\n[doctor] that sounds really nice very good\r\n[patient] it's just\r\n[doctor] yeah okay well so it looks like you're still smoking a pack of cigarettes a day\r\n[patient] yes i tried to stop smoking every now and then but it's still been hard to totally stop\r\n[doctor] okay and how is your blood pressure been doing are you keeping up with your medication\r\n[patient] i take my blood pressure when i can remember to do so\r\n[doctor] okay yeah it's really important to keep up with your blood pressure check that regularly i'm totally going off script and you know might want to keep a log of that as well and check your blood pressures regularly so okay well let me do a just a quick exam of your eyes if you can take off your glasses and just rest your chin on the chin rest okay so the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes right eye the cornea is clear no mvi pciol cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees without any tears or holes or pe changes in the fovea posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula thickening of the retina presence of subretinal fluid and exudates accumulation positive for hemorrhage left eye the cornea is clear no mvi cup to disc is . three or pe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage or subretinal fluid retina is attached okay so i reviewed the results of your diagnostic tests so for the oct so it shows drusen deposit and the retinal pigment epithelium subretinal fluid accumulation choroidal neovascular membrane can be visualized fluorescein angiography reveals focal areas of leakage in the right eye consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration so the diagnostic tests and the eye exam are really indicative of neovascular age related macular degeneration so this is advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss and it really happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina and they will leak fluid and blood and hints the name wet amd and can create a large blind spot in the center of the visual field and this is really with the most common cause for severe loss of vision so my plan is to give you an injection of lucentes once a month it's injected into the vitreous portion of the eye after it's been numbed and injections are given regularly over a period of time it may slow the rate of vision decline or stop further vision loss but however the disease and loss it may also progress despite treatment do you have any questions\r\n[patient] i do not no that sounds great\r\n[doctor]

The pain may radiate into his forearm on occasion, but does not extend up to his shoulder. He denies any history of trauma or injury, but he did start making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic and suspects that his symptoms could be related to that. His symptoms affect his ability to lift objects or perform his typical activities of daily living. Ibuprofen provides minimal symptomatic relief.\r\n\r\nSOCIAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe patient reports that he began making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\nMEDICATIONS\r\n\r\nThe patient reports that he has been taking ibuprofen.\r\n\r\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\r\n\r\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right elbow pain.\r\n\r\nVITALS\r\n\r\nNormal\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL EXAM\r\n\r\nMSK: Examination of the right elbow: Moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle.

I want him to take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours with food for a full week and ice the elbow for 20 minutes, 3 times daily. Finally, I advised the patient to rest his elbow and avoid doing any pottery for the next couple of weeks.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nThe patient will follow up in 1 week."

stone so can you tell me what's going on how are you feeling and you're my my patient\r\n[patient] and i'm your patient yeah\r\n[doctor] yeah\r\n[patient] i've been having pains let's just say for the last two weeks\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] it's it starts up in the right flank and radiates down to my groin and you know it it's under control but i have bouts where it kinda gets a little out of control\r\n[doctor] okay so is it is it a constant pain or does it come and go for you\r\n[patient] it comes and goes it depends on how much i've been drinking and you know what sort of activities i've been doing but it's still there\r\n[doctor] alright so have you noticed any pain when you've been urinating\r\n[patient] not really\r\n[doctor] okay have you noticed any blood in your urine\r\n[patient] no blood i did have an episode where the pain radiated to one of my testicles which was kinda weird but but yeah it it sort of calmed down a little bit in that regards\r\n[doctor] okay have you taken anything for the pain\r\n[patient] yeah i've been taking some ibuprofen and that kinda like calms it down a little bit but it persists\r\n[doctor] okay and what would you say like your pain score is out of ten\r\n[patient] it's probably a four out of ten when it gets a little more out of control for the most part it's probably in the order of one or two out of ten\r\n[doctor] okay so it is it's it's it's not too bad\r\n[patient] it's a new ones yeah but i know it's there it does n't go away\r\n[doctor] okay yeah yeah a lot of my patients you know have that that minor pain so you\r\n[patient] i'm a horrible active by the way\r\n[doctor] no yeah that's that's that's totally fine that's totally fine you know i'm just playing the doctor on tv so good good alright so have you had any other symptoms nausea vomiting anything like that\r\n[patient] no nausea no vomiting i had some i felt like it might have been like chills but no fevers nothing along those lines\r\n[doctor] okay that's good do you know anybody in your family that has had kidney stones in the past\r\n[patient] yeah all in my family has had kidney stones in the past\r\n[doctor] no well they did n't set you up good did they\r\n[patient] yeah i i i guess i can blame them but but yeah it's been a it's been an issue with the family for as long as i've been aware of\r\n[doctor] okay alright and i'm reading here it looks like you've had them before as well right\r\n[patient] i have yeah i passed some by myself and i've had to have surgery a couple of times as well\r\n[doctor] okay so the ones that you passed by yourself how many days would you say it would take to to pass\r\n[patient] usually within within a week i manage to to get them out\r\n[doctor] okay alright so you got anything fun plan for the weekend\r\n[patient] just getting this pain under control\r\n[doctor] okay well that that sounds like a good plan we can definitely help you out with that alright so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you looks like your blood pressure is a little bit elevated and i think that's probably because you're in pain and that's understandable everything else looks fine so on pressing on your abdomen does that hurt\r\n[patient] no no no pain\r\n[doctor] alright so press here in the back and your cva does that back here in\r\n[patient] yeah it's a little tender yeah it's little tender\r\n[doctor] okay so on your physical exam there seems to be no tenderness to palpation of your abdomen there is cva tenderness on your your right side here and that's due to that kidney stone so we did get a a ct scan before you came in so it does show that you have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size located on the proximal right ureter so that's that duct that passes from your kidney to your bladder i do n't see any evidence of hydronephrosis so there is nothing obstructing causing swelling in your your kidney so that's good to hear so i do n't think you hopefully wo n't need any surgery for this one so let's talk a bit little bit about on my assessment and plan so you know you've done this a couple of times you have that kidney stone so what i want you to do is just have you continue to push fluids and hopefully we can pass the stone your pain your pain you're doing okay right now so i'm just gon na continue you on that ibuprofen do you think that's that's working you said for you\r\n[patient] so far so good but since the weekend is coming around i i i rather have something stronger if it's possible\r\n[doctor] okay so i can prescribe you some tramadol you know that should help fifty milligrams that should help you out if you do have any of that pain if you get any breakthrough pain from that you can take that ibuprofen it should help you you know with everything and hopefully you can get through that weekend i know you went to the your pcp prior to coming to see me did they give you a strainer\r\n[patient] they did they did yeah and i've been i've been using that but so far nothing\r\n[doctor] okay so continue to use the strainer whenever you urinate so hopefully we can catch the stone i'm also gon na order a bmp a urinalysis and urine culture and based on what that shows we can see if we need to put you on any antibiotics i do n't think you have an infection but you know there is that possibility and then i want to see you again in one to two weeks if you are still having symptoms and if you know you still have the stone with you we can talk about further treatment possible lithotripsy you know that's the shockwave treatment i'm pretty sure you've had that prior to\r\n[patient] yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what i want\r\n[doctor] what that is okay so do you have any other questions for me\r\n[patient] no i'm friend\r\n[doctor] alright so i'll see you again in two weeks i'll have my nurse come in and bring you that prescription for the tramadol and i think we are all good\r\n[patient] perfect thank

going on how are you feeling and you're my my patient\r\n[patient] and i'm your patient yeah\r\n[doctor] yeah\r\n[patient] i've been having pains let's just say for the last two weeks\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] it's it starts up in the right flank and radiates down to my groin and you know it it's under control but i have bouts where it kinda gets a little out of control\r\n[doctor] okay so is it is it a constant pain or does it come and go for you\r\n[patient] it comes and goes it depends on how much i've been drinking and you know what sort of activities i've been doing but it's still there\r\n[doctor] alright so have you noticed any pain when you've been urinating\r\n[patient] not really\r\n[doctor] okay have you noticed any blood in your urine\r\n[patient] no blood i did have an episode where the pain radiated to one of my testicles which was kinda weird but but yeah it it sort of calmed down a little bit in that regards\r\n[doctor] okay have you taken anything for the pain\r\n[patient] yeah i've been taking some ibuprofen and that kinda like calms it down a little bit but it persists\r\n[doctor] okay and what would you say like your pain score is out of ten\r\n[patient] it's probably a four out of ten when it gets a little more out of control for the most part it's probably in the order of one or two out of ten\r\n[doctor] okay so it is it's it's it's not too bad\r\n[patient] it's a new ones yeah but i know it's there it does n't go away\r\n[doctor] okay yeah yeah a lot of my patients you know have that that minor pain so you\r\n[patient] i'm a horrible active by the way\r\n[doctor] no yeah that's that's that's totally fine that's totally fine you know i'm just playing the doctor on tv so good good alright so have you had any other symptoms nausea vomiting anything like that\r\n[patient] no nausea no vomiting i had some i felt like it might have been like chills but no fevers nothing along those lines\r\n[doctor] okay that's good do you know anybody in your family that has had kidney stones in the past\r\n[patient] yeah all in my family has had kidney stones in the past\r\n[doctor] no well they did n't set you up good did they\r\n[patient] yeah i i i guess i can blame them but but yeah it's been a it's been an issue with the family for as long as i've been aware of\r\n[doctor] okay alright and i'm reading here it looks like you've had them before as well right\r\n[patient] i have yeah i passed some by myself and i've had to have surgery a couple of times as well\r\n[doctor] okay so the ones that you passed by yourself how many days would you say it would take to to pass\r\n[patient] usually within within a week i manage to to get them out\r\n[doctor] okay alright so you got anything fun plan for the weekend\r\n[patient] just getting this pain under control\r\n[doctor] okay well that that sounds like a good plan we can definitely help you out with that alright so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you looks like your blood pressure is a little bit elevated and i think that's probably because you're in pain and that's understandable everything else looks fine so on pressing on your abdomen does that hurt\r\n[patient] no no no pain\r\n[doctor] alright so press here in the back and your cva does that back here in\r\n[patient] yeah it's a little tender yeah it's little tender\r\n[doctor] okay so on your physical exam there seems to be no tenderness to palpation of your abdomen there is cva tenderness on your your right side here and that's due to that kidney stone so we did get a a ct scan before you came in so it does show that you have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size located on the proximal right ureter so that's that duct that passes from your kidney to your bladder i do n't see any evidence of hydronephrosis so there is nothing obstructing causing swelling in your your kidney so that's good to hear so i do n't think you hopefully wo n't need any surgery for this one so let's talk a bit little bit about on my assessment and plan so you know you've done this a couple of times you have that kidney stone so what i want you to do is just have you continue to push fluids and hopefully we can pass the stone your pain your pain you're doing okay right now so i'm just gon na continue you on that ibuprofen do you think that's that's working you said for you\r\n[patient] so far so good but since the weekend is coming around i i i rather have something stronger if it's possible\r\n[doctor] okay so i can prescribe you some tramadol you know that should help fifty milligrams that should help you out if you do have any of that pain if you get any breakthrough pain from that you can take that ibuprofen it should help you you know with everything and hopefully you can get through that weekend i know you went to the your pcp prior to coming to see me did they give you a strainer\r\n[patient] they did they did yeah and i've been i've been using that but so far nothing\r\n[doctor] okay so continue to use the strainer whenever you urinate so hopefully we can catch the stone i'm also gon na order a bmp a urinalysis and urine culture and based on what that shows we can see if we need to put you on any antibiotics i do n't think you have an infection but you know there is that possibility and then i want to see you again in one to two weeks if you are still having symptoms and if you know you still have the stone with you we can talk about further treatment possible lithotripsy you know that's the shockwave treatment i'm pretty sure you've had that prior to\r\n[patient] yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what i want\r\n[doctor] what that is okay so do you have any other questions for me\r\n[patient] no i'm friend\r\n[doctor] alright so i'll see you again in two weeks i'll have my nurse come in and bring you that prescription for the tramadol and i think we are all good\r\n[patient] perfect thank you\r\n[doctor] alright great",
    "reference": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\r\n\r\nRight flank pain.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\r\n\r\nJoshua Reyes is a pleasant 18-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of right flank pain.\r\n\r\nFor the last 2 weeks, the patient has been experiencing pain that starts in his right flank and radiates down into his groin. He also recalls one episode in which the pain radiated down into one of his testicles. Although his pain is intermittent depending on his fluid intake and activity level, he rates the pain as a 4/10 at its worst. Otherwise, the pain is a 1-2/10. He denies any pain with urination, hematuria, nausea, vomiting, or fevers, but recalls possibly having chills at one point. Over-the-counter ibuprofen provides partial relief of his pain. Of note, the patient has a personal history of kidney stones, some which were passed independently, usually within a week, while others required surgical intervention or lithotripsy. He also has several family members with a histories of kidney stones.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe patient has a personal history of kidney stones treated conservatively, surgically, and with lithotripsy.\r\n\r\nFAMILY HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe patient has a significant family history of kidney stones.\r\n\r\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\r\n\r\nConstitutional: Reports chills. Denies fever\r\nGastrointestinal: Denies nausea or vomiting.\r\nGenitourinary: Reports right flank pain. Denies dysuria or hematuria.\r\n\r\nVITALS\r\n\r\nBlood pressure: Slightly elevated\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL EXAM\r\n\r\nGI/GU: No tenderness to palpation of the abdomen.\r\nMSK: Examination of the right flank: CVA tenderness.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nCT scan of the right flank was reviewed today, 05/06/2022. It revealed a kidney stone measuring 0.5 cm in size, located on the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.\r\n\r\nASSESSMENT\r\n\r\nKidney stone, right side.\r\n\r\nPLAN\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and CT scan findings today, we discussed the diagnosis and treatment plan. I recommend that we treat the patient conservatively at this point. I advised him to continue drinking plenty of fluids so he can hopefully pass the stone. He has been controlling his pain with over-the-counter ibuprofen and should continue to do so. I also prescribed tramadol 50 mg for any breakthrough pain. His primary care physician provided him with a strainer and I advised him to continue using this as well. I want to order a BMP, a urinalysis, and a urine culture to rule out any need for antibiotics. We will have him follow up in 2 weeks for re-evaluation. If he has not passed the kidney stone at that time, we can consider proceeding with lithotripsy.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nThe patient will follow up in 2 weeks."

    "system_output": "\n    CONVERSATION:\n    [doctor] next patient is emily hernandez . date of birth , march 26 2001 . this is a 20 year old female being seen today for our yearly follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy . due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in april 2020 , she was switched from symbicort to wixela . she also uses zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms , which tend to work well . she also has known peanut allergy , she does tolerate almonds and cashews . please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the act score is 21 . please put under interval history , written consent is obtained today to use dax for documentation .\r\n[doctor] hi emily , how are you ?\r\n[patient] i'm pretty good , how are you ?\r\n[doctor] i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ?\r\n[patient] yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .\r\n[doctor] okay , and that's the 250/50 dose , correct ?\r\n[patient] yes , correct .\r\n[doctor] perfect . so how does that compare ?\r\n[patient] i mean , it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .\r\n[doctor] and that's one puff twice a day ?\r\n[patient] mm-hmm .\r\n[doctor] okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ?\r\n[patient] rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .\r\n[doctor] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity .\r\n[patient] yes .\r\n[doctor] okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ?\r\n[patient] yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .\r\n[doctor] okay .\r\n[patient] and i've been trying to use my daily if i can a little less because i'm trying to go into the military soon .\r\n[doctor] no kidding , that's great .\r\n[patient] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .\r\n[doctor] really ?\r\n[patient] yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .\r\n[doctor] and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ?\r\n[patient] mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .\r\n[doctor] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ?\r\n[patient] probably about three or four .\r\n[doctor] okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ?\r\n[patient] yes , that's correct .\r\n[doctor] okay .\r\n[patient] and it's either in the morning or at night that i'm taking it .\r\n[doctor] okay , and do you think that's working okay ?\r\n[patient] i do .\r\n[doctor] great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ?\r\n[patient] nope .\r\n[doctor] okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then .\r\n[patient] nope .\r\n[doctor] okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ?\r\n[patient] so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .\r\n[doctor] now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ?\r\n[patient] correct .\r\n[doctor] okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ?\r\n[patient] yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .\r\n[doctor] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ?\r\n[patient] yeah , that's right .\r\n[doctor] okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ?\r\n[patient] not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .\r\n[doctor] and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ?\r\n[patient] yeah , it does , it works great .\r\n[doctor] wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ?\r\n[patient] yep , that's correct .\r\n[doctor] okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ?\r\n[patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .\r\n[doctor] super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it .\r\n[patient] yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .\r\n[doctor] okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ?\r\n[patient] yes .\r\n[doctor] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year .\r\n[patient] yeah , okay .\r\n[doctor] and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ?\r\n[patient] i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .\r\n[doctor] okay .\r\n[patient] and i remember having them and nothing happened , but i usually just tend to stay away from them , um , really if i can help it .\r\n[doctor] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards .\r\n[patient] okay .\r\n[doctor] and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment .\r\n[patient] all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit . so i am sure that might have an effect .\r\n[doctor] it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape .\r\n[patient] okay .\r\n[doctor] yeah . and we'll see where you stand at that point .\r\n[patient] all right , that sounds good .\r\n[doctor] well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me .\r\n[patient] okay .\r\n[doctor] all right so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth ? big ahh .\r\n[patient] ahh .\r\n[doctor] good . okay let me take a peek in your nose . all right , good . you can put your mask back on .\r\n[patient] okay .\r\n[doctor] and go ahead take a big breath in and out . good , your lungs sound terrific . i'll listen to your heart , breathe quietly . okay very good .\r\n[patient] awesome .\r\n[doctor] so your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple years ago , and actually looks a little bit better . you may not remember but when we last completed the test in 2019 , uh , do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time ?\r\n[patient] i think it was the smoke . there were so many fires at that point and i remember coming in and looking out the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke .\r\n[doctor] yes , you're absolutely right , that was a bad year . that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed . well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better . here's what i think , so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ?\r\n[patient] correct .\r\n[doctor] okay . most insurances do limit what we can use .\r\n[patient] yeah i do know that .\r\n[doctor] okay so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now . we would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day , so that's an option . option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med .\r\n[patient] mm-hmm\r\n[doctor] so the one that kaiser covers is alvesco . the thing about alvesco , though , is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night . so it's a bit more work . um , it's not breath activated but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do . some of the newer guidelines for asthma that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixela or alvesco only when you're ill , or say during smoke season . so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year . unless you found out that you're getting\r\n[ inaudible 00:09:25 ] sick having issues every month , then that would indicate would pull back too much .\r\n[patient] okay .\r\n[doctor] that we had too much , yeah .\r\n[patient] okay .\r\n[doctor] um , so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers , uh , when you're ill or it's smoke season , but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco .\r\n[patient] okay , that actually sounds really good .\r\n[doctor] okay great . so i will call that in for you , it will be the lower dose , 80 mcg , and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day .\r\n[patient] all right\r\n[doctor] okay and that'll be on the box when i call it in . you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you .\r\n[patient] okay , got it .\r\n[doctor] and then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in four months to see how you're doing , and then be able to document that you're doing well . sometimes , not always , the military will require documentation on breathing tests .\r\n[patient] okay .\r\n[doctor] is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with helen ?\r\n[patient] yeah i believe she updated it . it should be kaiser permanente broadway .\r\n[doctor] okay perfect . i'll make sure it's the alvesco and then i'll renew your albuterol and epipen as well .\r\n[patient] awesome , thank you .\r\n[doctor] you're welcome . uh , then the zyrtec , do you pick it up over the counter or do get- do you get it as a prescription ?\r\n[patient] i just get it over the counter .\r\n[doctor] okay got it . and do you have a nebulizer that you would , uh , need refills on ?\r\n[patient] i do n't think i need any refills , i have n't used that in such a long time . i think the last time was when i had bronchitis , or there was few select times when i had to use it when i was kid .\r\n[doctor] okay good . well i think we have our game plan .\r\n[patient] okay awesome .\r\n[doctor] and do the alvesco two puffs twice a day and your albuterol if you need it . the zyrtec 10 milligrams as you need it and continue to stay away from peanuts and tree nuts and i'll refill your epipen .\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] all right so we've got it .\r\n[patient] great .\r\n[doctor] all right i'll have you take this to the front and i'm gon na say four months re-check for asthma and we'll repeat the spirometer- spirometry at that time .\r\n[patient] okay sounds good .\r\n[doctor] all right well thanks so much and you have a great day .\r\n[patient] you too .\r\n[doctor] and we'll do a follow-up in four months with act and spirometry , sooner if needed . follow-up 25 minutes .\n\n    SUMMARY:\n    Please generate a medical summary based on the following clinical notes.

    "source": "[doctor] next patient is emily hernandez . date of birth , march 26 2001 . this is a 20 year old female being seen today for our yearly follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy . due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in april 2020 , she was switched from symbicort to wixela . she also uses zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms , which tend to work well . she also has known peanut allergy , she does tolerate almonds and cashews . please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the act score is 21 . please put under interval history , written consent is obtained today to use dax for documentation .\r\n[doctor] hi emily , how are you ?\r\n[patient] i'm pretty good , how are you ?\r\n[doctor] i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ?\r\n[patient] yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .\r\n[doctor] okay , and that's the 250/50 dose , correct ?\r\n[patient] yes , correct .\r\n[doctor] perfect . so how does that compare ?\r\n[patient] i mean , it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .\r\n[doctor] and that's one puff twice a day ?\r\n[patient] mm-hmm .\r\n[doctor] okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ?\r\n[patient] rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .\r\n[doctor] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity .\r\n[patient] yes .\r\n[doctor] okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ?\r\n[patient] yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .\r\n[doctor] okay .\r\n[patient] and i've been trying to use my daily if i can a little less because i'm trying to go into the military soon .\r\n[doctor] no kidding , that's great .\r\n[patient] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .\r\n[doctor] really ?\r\n[patient] yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .\r\n[doctor] and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ?\r\n[patient] mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .\r\n[doctor] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ?\r\n[patient] probably about three or four .\r\n[doctor] okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ?\r\n[patient] yes , that's correct .\r\n[doctor] okay .\r\n[patient] and it's either in the morning or at night that i'm taking it .\r\n[doctor] okay , and do you think that's working okay ?\r\n[patient] i do .\r\n[doctor] great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ?\r\n[patient] nope .\r\n[doctor] okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then .\r\n[patient] nope .\r\n[doctor] okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ?\r\n[patient] so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .\r\n[doctor] now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ?\r\n[patient] correct .\r\n[doctor] okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ?\r\n[patient] yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .\r\n[doctor] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ?\r\n[patient] yeah , that's right .\r\n[doctor] okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ?\r\n[patient] not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .\r\n[doctor] and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ?\r\n[patient] yeah , it does , it works great .\r\n[doctor] wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ?\r\n[patient] yep , that's correct .\r\n[doctor] okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ?\r\n[patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .\r\n[doctor] super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it .\r\n[patient] yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .\r\n[doctor] okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ?\r\n[patient] yes .\r\n[doctor] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year .\r\n[patient] yeah , okay .\r\n[doctor] and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ?\r\n[patient] i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .\r\n[doctor] okay .\r\n[patient] and i remember having them and nothing happened , but i usually just tend to stay away from them , um , really if i can help it .\r\n[doctor] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards .\r\n[patient] okay .\r\n[doctor] and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment .\r\n[patient] all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit . so i am sure that might have an effect .\r\n[doctor] it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape .\r\n[patient] okay .\r\n[doctor] yeah . and we'll see where you stand at that point .\r\n[patient] all right , that sounds good .\r\n[doctor] well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me .\r\n[patient] okay .\r\n[doctor] all right so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth ? big ahh .\r\n[patient] ahh .\r\n[doctor] good . okay let me take a peek in your nose . all right , good . you can put your mask back on .\r\n[patient] okay .\r\n[doctor] and go ahead take a big breath in and out . good , your lungs sound terrific . i'll listen to your heart , breathe quietly . okay very good .\r\n[patient] awesome .\r\n[doctor] so your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple years ago , and actually looks a little bit better . you may not remember but when we last completed the test in 2019 , uh , do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time ?\r\n[patient] i think it was the smoke . there were so many fires at that point and i remember coming in and looking out the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke .\r\n[doctor] yes , you're absolutely right , that was a bad year . that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed . well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better . here's what i think , so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ?\r\n[patient] correct .\r\n[doctor] okay . most insurances do limit what we can use .\r\n[patient] yeah i do know that .\r\n[doctor] okay so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now . we would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day , so that's an option . option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med .\r\n[patient] mm-hmm\r\n[doctor] so the one that kaiser covers is alvesco . the thing about alvesco , though , is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night . so it's a bit more work . um , it's not breath activated but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do . some of the newer guidelines for asthma that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixela or alvesco only when you're ill , or say during smoke season . so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year . unless you found out that you're getting\r\n[ inaudible 00:09:25 ] sick having issues every month , then that would indicate would pull back too much .\r\n[patient] okay .\r\n[doctor] that we had too much , yeah .\r\n[patient] okay .\r\n[doctor] um , so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers , uh , when you're ill or it's smoke season , but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco .\r\n[patient] okay , that actually sounds really good .\r\n[doctor] okay great . so i will call that in for you , it will be the lower dose , 80 mcg , and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day .\r\n[patient] all right\r\n[doctor] okay and that'll be on the box when i call it in . you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you .\r\n[patient] okay , got it .\r\n[doctor] and then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in four months to see how you're doing , and then be able to document that you're doing well . sometimes , not always , the military will require documentation on breathing tests .\r\n[patient] okay .\r\n[doctor] is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with helen ?\r\n[patient] yeah i believe she updated it . it should be kaiser permanente broadway .\r\n[doctor] okay perfect . i'll make sure it's the alvesco and then i'll renew your albuterol and epipen as well .\r\n[patient] awesome , thank you .\r\n[doctor] you're welcome . uh , then the zyrtec , do you pick it up over the counter or do get- do you get it as a prescription ?\r\n[patient] i just get it over the counter .\r\n[doctor] okay got it . and do you have a nebulizer that you would , uh , need refills on ?\r\n[patient] i do n't think i need any refills , i have n't used that in such a long time . i think the last time was when i had bronchitis , or there was few select times when i had to use it when i was kid .\r\n[doctor] okay good . well i think we have our game plan .\r\n[patient] okay awesome .\r\n[doctor] and do the alvesco two puffs twice a day and your albuterol if you need it . the zyrtec 10 milligrams as you need it and continue to stay away from peanuts and tree nuts and i'll refill your epipen .\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] all right so we've got it .\r\n[patient] great .\r\n[doctor] all right i'll have you take this to the front and i'm gon na say four months re-check for asthma and we'll repeat the spirometer- spirometry at that time .\r\n[patient] okay sounds good .\r\n[doctor] all right well thanks so much and you have a great day .\r\n[patient] you too .\r\n[doctor] and we'll do a follow-up in four months with act and spirometry , sooner if needed . follow-up 25 minutes .",
    "reference": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\r\n\r\nFollow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\r\n\r\nEmily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female presenting today for an annual follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy. Due to insurance changes during the interim of our last office appointment from 04/2020, she was switched from Symbicort to Wixela. She uses Zyrtec in the spring, summer, and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms, which tends to work well. She has known peanut and tree nut allergies, which she tries to avoid. She does tolerate almonds and cashew.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hernandez is trying to join the military, who require a certain fitness level without use of a rescue or maintenance inhaler, so she has been weaning off her inhalers. She uses albuterol prior to a run, but otherwise functions without it. She has been reducing her Wixela dose, using 1 inhalation once daily 3 times per week, with remaining days using it twice per day as prescribed. She feels this is working well. She denies urgent care or emergency room visits for respiratory issues in the past year. She denies requiring prednisone for breathing issues in the past year.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to be enlisted in the military in early spring of 2022. She is currently undergoing exertional testing to this purpose. She explains that this gives hers 6 to 7 months to show that she can exert herself without needing any inhalers.\r\n\r\nOver the past year, she admits to vaping and smoking, though she is trying to quit and has cut down her use significantly.\r\n\r\nShe notes having a nebulizer but denies needing it recently and has only used it in her past for upper respiratory infections and as a child a few times.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hernandez uses Zyrtec during the spring and fall but does not typically have to use it consistently during the summer. She confirms she has been taking Zyrtec 3 days per week when she works outside, and it works well to control her symptoms.\r\n\r\nShe has been successfully avoiding peanuts. Incident from last year was reviewed where she was exposed to peanuts when she was cleaning an Enterprise rental car that had a lot of peanuts in it. She developed contact hives when the peanuts encountered her skin. Over the past year she denies additional accidental exposures. She wears long sleeves and changes her gloves between each cleaning. She thinks it is likely that she has been in contact with cars that contained peanuts, but due to her protective measures she did not touch them directly. She confirmed she always keeps an EpiPen with her.\r\n\r\nThe patient is also avoiding tree nuts. She did ingest almonds without issue following our discussion that she could try them. Despite tolerating them well, she continues to avoid all tree nuts.\r\n\r\nPAST HISTORY\r\n\r\nMedical\r\nAsthma.\r\nAllergy rhinitis.\r\nFood allergies to peanut and tree nuts.\r\n\r\nSOCIAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nCurrently smokes tobacco and vapes, trying to reduce and interested in cessation in preparation for joining the army.\r\n\r\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\r\n\r\nWixela Inhub 250 mcg-50 mcg/dose powder for inhalation. 1 puff 2 times daily in the morning and evening.\r\nProair HFA as needed.\r\nEpiPen as needed.\r\nAlvesco 80 mcg 2 puff 2 times daily.\r\n\r\nALLERGIES\r\n\r\nPeanuts cause a severe, anaphylactic reaction.\r\nMontelukast sodium, “seizure-like” reaction.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nAsthma Control Test (ACT) Results: ACT score is 21.\r\nCurrent food skin test sensitivities include peanuts.\r\n\r\nASSESSMENT\r\n\r\n• Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated.\r\n• Allergic rhinitis.\r\n• Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts.\r\n\r\nEmily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female who presented today for her yearly follow-up appointment for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.\r\n\r\nPLAN\r\n\r\nModerate persistent asthma, uncomplicated\r\nThe patient has been using Wixela inhaler daily and admits to reducing her daily dose to one puff per day, 3-4 days per week as she feels she does not always need it the full dose. Additionally, she aspires to join the military and she must meet certain physical fitness requirements without the use of her inhaler. I counseled the patient on current asthma treatment guidelines which recommend using Wixela and Alvesco only when needed during periods of illness. The patient agreed to reducing her medicine to Alvesco which is a single medication, versus 2 in Welixa. The patient will continue to use her albuterol inhaler as needed. Her ACT score is 21 today and her spirometry test today was better than it was in 2019, though she recalls that it was smoky from wildfires during her last breathing test.\r\n\r\nAllergic rhinitis\r\nShe will continue to use Zyrtec as needed, primarily during spring and fall and sometimes in summer. Her current dose cadence is 3 times per week when she works outside. Symptoms are currently under control.\r\n\r\nAnaphylactic reaction due to peanuts\r\nThe patient has successfully avoided peanuts. Plan is to continue with current methods to avoid exposure. I will refill her EpiPen which expires annually.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nModerate persistent asthma, uncomplicated\r\nStart Alvesco, 2 puffs twice daily. Keep Wixela in case Alvesco does not work well. Continue albuterol as needed. Return in 4 months to repeat ACT and spirometry testing.\r\n\r\nAllergic rhinitis\r\nContinue Zyrtec 10 mg daily as needed.\r\n\r\nAnaphylactic reaction due to peanuts\r\nContinue strict avoidance of peanuts. I will refill her EpiPen today."

Only include sections for which there is sufficient information available.\n     CHIEF COMPLAINT\nHeadache\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\nDonna, a 37-year-old female, presents with a chief complaint of headache. She has a history of hypertension and diabetes. Donna reports that her headaches have been worsening recently, occurring more frequently and with increased intensity. She mentions that her blood pressure has been elevated, with readings of 160/87 mmHg and 175/92 mmHg, compared to a normal reading of 124/82 mmHg during her last visit. Donna admits to occasionally forgetting to take her prescribed lisinopril, particularly on weekends. She checks her blood sugar regularly, which has been mostly within a range of 120-140 mg/dL, with occasional readings down to 100 mg/dL. She denies any recent changes in urination, congestion, cough, or runny nose. Donna rates her initial headache pain at 7/10 and notes that Tylenol provides partial relief, reducing the pain to around 4-5/10. She has not experienced similar headaches in the past and has only had migraines once or twice a year.\n\nVITALS\nNot provided in the transcript.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\nDonna reports tenderness on tapping her forehead and a slight tenderness when pressing on her cheekbones. She experiences mild tenderness in her neck around the jaw area. No lymphadenopathy noted.\n\nRESULTS\nNo specific results from diagnostic tests are mentioned in the transcript.\n\nASSESSMENT\nThe patient's elevated blood pressure readings and persistent headaches suggest uncontrolled hypertension, likely contributing to her headache symptoms. The differential diagnosis includes tension-type headaches, migraines, or secondary causes such as sinus issues, despite the lack of associated symptoms. Donna's diabetes management appears adequate, with controlled blood sugar levels, but her hypertension requires closer attention.\n\nPLAN\nThe doctor plans to increase Donna's lisinopril dosage to 40 mg daily to better manage her hypertension. She will continue to monitor her blood pressure and perform additional blood tests, including a hemoglobin A1c level, to assess her diabetes control. The doctor recommends continuing her walking routine and suggests diabetic education to improve her understanding of managing her diabetes. Donna is advised to return for a follow-up appointment with either herself or Dr. Ruth to reassess her condition and adjust her treatment plan as needed.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n- Continue taking Tylenol for headache relief.\n- Increase lisinopril dosage to 40 mg daily.\n- Monitor and record blood pressure readings.\n- Perform regular blood sugar checks.\n- Engage in walking exercises.\n- Review and understand diabetic education materials.\n- Schedule a follow-up appointment with the doctor or Dr. Ruth for further evaluation and adjustment of treatment.

i've been taking it maybe like once a week but the past three weeks it's been really high than usual so i was a little worried\r\n[doctor] do you remember the numbers that you're getting on your blood pressure readings\r\n[patient] yeah so one of them was like one sixty over eighty seven and then the last one was like one seventy five over ninety two\r\n[doctor] okay so it's really high i was looking back and it looks like your blood pressure was pretty normal last time we saw you is one twenty four over eighty two have you been able to take your blood pressure medicine the lisinopril that you've been prescribed\r\n[patient] i have but sometimes i forget i'm i'm embarrassed to tell you that but yeah sometimes i forget i get busy like especially on the weekends i'm very good during the week but on the weekends i tend to forget it and that's when i'm most busy too\r\n[doctor] yeah well i'm also curious you know you have diabetes have you been checking your blood sugar\r\n[patient] yeah i have because i thought maybe you know that's why i'm getting the headaches maybe my sugar was too low or maybe too high but my sugar has been okay it's been running like one twenty sometimes it does get down to like one hundred\r\n[doctor] okay and have you noticed are you urinating more than usual or anything like that\r\n[patient] not really so much it's it's been pretty much the same but pretty normal\r\n[doctor] okay and when you get these headaches what are you taking for them\r\n[patient] well i take my tylenol hoping it'll just you know go away and then it does some just for a little bit but then it it just goes throughout the day and i start to get them again\r\n[doctor] okay and when you first had the headaches what would you rate the headache at zero no pain ten the worst pain ever\r\n[patient] i would say when i first get them it's about i would say a seven out of ten\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] yeah\r\n[doctor] and then after you take the tylenol what does it go down to\r\n[patient] it goes down to probably about a four maybe five it i still feel it i still feel annoying but it's not as pounding as as it normally would be\r\n[doctor] okay\r\n[patient] if i did n't take the tylenol\r\n[doctor] yeah and have you ever had headaches like this before\r\n[patient] not like this you know you know as you know sometimes i get migraine but i know i never really take anything for it that's like once a year or once or every two years but not like not like this one headaches like this one\r\n[doctor] okay and have you had any congestion anything like that cough runny nose\r\n[patient] yeah i thought maybe because you know now it's springtime and i tend to get my allergies but it it's it's very different and i've not actually had any like runny nose or cough or congestion along with the headache\r\n[doctor] okay if you tap on your forehead do you have any tenderness\r\n[patient] right here\r\n[doctor] yeah\r\n[patient] just a little not really too much\r\n[doctor] okay if you tap down here on these bones your cheek bones any tenderness there\r\n[patient] a little bit not as much as i guess if i tap up here\r\n[doctor] okay and then if you kinda push on your neck around here any tenderness\r\n[patient] it it's a little tender but it's not it is a little bit i'd say\r\n[doctor] okay okay so you do n't have any frontal sinus tenderness no maxillary sinus tenderness it sounds like you do n't have any lymphadenopathy that would just be if your lymph nodes were tender so yeah you know let's just talk about a few things that i wan na do and then i want you to actually come in and and be seen by doctor ruth so first off your headache i think taking tylenol is great you can keep taking that you know your lisinopril you're on twenty milligrams once a day which is a medium dose but i think we can increase that so for your hypertension and your headaches i'm gon na have you increase your lisinopril to forty milligrams once a day\r\n[patient] okay\r\n[doctor] and then i want you to keep checking your blood pressure and i wan na order some blood tests i'd like to get some just normal blood work we'll get a hemoglobin a1c some laboratory tests things like that and and then for your diabetes i'm gon na have some diabetic education for you that i want you to be able to review it sounds like your blood sugar has been running a little bit high and after you get the blood tests after that's all done i want you to come in to see me or doctor ruth and we'll just make sure that everything is okay that we get your blood pressure under control any questions for me\r\n[patient] no i mean i've been walking and i know i get the headaches but is it alright if i still continue my walks\r\n[doctor] yeah that's great i think exercise is wonderful for everything going on go ahead and walk still\r\n[patient] okay great we'll do that thank you\r\n[doctor] you're welcome thanks so much donna",

She started to fall, however she was with her boyfriend, who caught her. She presented to the emergency room after this. While in the emergency room, her blood pressure was nearly 200 and she had a headache.\r\n\r\nHer blood pressure is typically normal, however will become elevated approximately one week a month. She notes it is typically elevated because she is traveling a lot that week for work. While traveling, she is not eating as well and does not monitor her blood pressure. The patient is taking her lisinopril as prescribed.\r\n\r\nRegarding her depression, she states she is doing well. Last year she started therapy and she has been going once a week, which has helped. Her support system is great and includes her boyfriend, mom, and brother.\r\n\r\nThe patient notes she has a little bit of nasal congestion, which she attributes to her seasonal allergies. She denies chest pain and shortness of breath.\r\n\r\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\r\n\r\n• Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: Endorses nasal congestion from seasonal allergies.\r\n• Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain or dyspnea.\r\n• Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.\r\n• Neurological: Endorses lightheadedness and a headache.\r\n• Psychiatric: Endorses depression.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\r\n\r\n• Neck: No carotid bruits appreciable.\r\n• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.\r\n• Cardiovascular: Slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.\r\n• Musculoskeletal: Trace pitting edema in the bilateral lower extremities.\r\n\r\nVITALS REVIEWED\r\n\r\n• Blood Pressure: Elevated.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nElectrocardiogram stable in comparison to last year.\r\n\r\nEchocardiogram demonstrates decreased ejection fraction. Stable heart murmur.\r\n\r\nASSESSMENT\r\n\r\nMs. Diane Baker is a 28-year-old female with a past medical history significant for depression, and hypertension, who presents for emergency room follow-up.\r\n\r\nPLAN\r\n\r\nHypertension.\r\n• Medical Reasoning: This is not controlled at this time. The patient presented to the emergency department yesterday with an elevated blood pressure, presyncope, and headache. She has been compliant with lisinopril, but her blood pressures have been spiking once a month based on home monitoring; however, she admits to not taking her blood pressures while traveling recently. A recent EKG revealed changes from her chronic high blood pressure.\r\n• Medical Treatment: Increase lisinopril to 40 mg once a day.\r\n• Patient Education and Counseling: She will continue to check her blood pressures and report them to me through the patient portal. We will have to make adjustments if necessary.\r\n\r\nDepression.\r\n• Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well with weekly therapy.\r\n• Medical Treatment: Continue current management strategies. No medication to start at this time.\r\n• Patient Education and Counseling: She can contact me if she needs anything.\r\n\r\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\r\n"
