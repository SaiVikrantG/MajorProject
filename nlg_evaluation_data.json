She also reported experiencing lightheadedness and a recent episode of near-fainting while walking due to high blood pressure.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\nDiane, a 28-year-old female with a history of depression and hypertension, presented for emergency room follow-up. She reported that her blood pressure was very high during the ER visit, reaching almost 200. She experienced a headache and lightheadedness, which led to a fall that was prevented by her boyfriend. Diane has a history of her blood pressure \"skyrocketing\" once a week or month, often associated with poor diet and lack of adherence to her medication regimen when traveling. She has been taking lisinopril as prescribed and has been compliant with her medication when at home. She recently started therapy for her depression, which she attends weekly, and reports having a strong support system.\n\nVITALS\nBlood pressure was recorded as 190/110 mmHg during the visit.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\nOn examination, the patient had a slight two out of six systolic ejection murmur. Lung exam revealed clear lungs bilaterally, and there was trace pitting edema in both lower extremities. No carotid bruits were noted. An ECG showed changes consistent with chronic hypertension, and an echocardiogram confirmed a stable, slightly leaky heart valve.\n\nRESULTS\nRecent ECG and echocardiogram results were reviewed, showing no significant changes from previous assessments. Blood pressure readings from the emergency room visit were also reviewed.\n\nASSESSMENT\nThe patient's primary issues are uncontrolled hypertension and a stable, mild mitral regurgitation. Her depression is managed with ongoing psychotherapy, and she is compliant with her lisinopril when at home.\n\nPLAN\nThe plan includes increasing the lisinopril dosage to 40 mg daily to better control her hypertension. She will continue to monitor her blood pressure at home and report these readings via the patient portal. If her blood pressure remains uncontrolled, a second antihypertensive medication may be added. For her depression, she will continue with her current therapy and can contact the doctor if additional support is needed. No new medications are indicated for her depression at this time.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nThe patient is instructed to maintain her current lisinopril regimen and increase her dosage to 40 mg daily. She should monitor her blood pressure regularly and report these readings to the doctor. She is advised to continue attending her weekly psychotherapy sessions and to reach out to the doctor if her depression worsens or if she requires additional support. Follow-up in one month is recommended to assess the effectiveness of the increased lisinopril dosage and to further manage her hypertension and depression.

While in the emergency room, her blood pressure was nearly 200 and she had a headache.\n\nHer blood pressure is typically normal, however will become elevated approximately one week a month. She notes it is typically elevated because she is traveling a lot that week for work. While traveling, she is not eating as well and does not monitor her blood pressure.

    "system_output": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\nThe patient, Evelyn, reports occasional chest pain over the past month, which occurs when walking and subsides with rest. She denies any associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting. She also mentions recent nasal congestion due to allergies.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\nEvelyn is a 56-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, a prior carpal tunnel release, and a herniated disc. She presented for her annual exam. Over the past year, she has experienced no back pain or limitations related to her herniated disc, and her carpal tunnel release has been successful with full range of motion. However, she has been experiencing occasional chest pain, described as a burning sensation in the middle of her chest, occurring approximately three times a week.\n\nVITALS\nBlood pressure is under control, oxygenation is fine, and there are no reported lower extremity edema or muscle aches.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\nEvelyn's heart has a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur, previously noted. Lungs are clear, no carotid bruits, and no lower extremity edema. There are healed surgical scars on the right wrist from the carpal tunnel release.\n\nRESULTS\nAn echocardiogram shows a slightly low pumping function of the heart at 45% but improved over time. There is slight mitral regurgitation contributing to the murmur. An ECG reflects stable, prior coronary artery disease with no new changes. A lipid panel is pending, and she is currently on aspirin and toprol.\n\nASSESSMENT\nEvelyn's carpal tunnel release and herniated disc appear to be resolving well. The primary concern is her recurrent chest pain, which may indicate underlying coronary artery disease. No new changes were observed on the ECG, but the persistent chest pain warrants further investigation.\n\nPLAN\nContinue aspirin and toprol. Order a cardiac stress test to evaluate for additional blockages. Start crestor 20 mg once daily to manage cholesterol levels. Schedule follow-up appointments for the stress test and lipid panel results.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nEvelyn should report any worsening of symptoms or new symptoms to the healthcare provider immediately. She should continue taking her current medications and attend the scheduled stress test and lipid panel appointments. If she experiences any severe chest pain, she should seek emergency care.

He continues to wear a splint on the right wrist all the time and on the left only intermittently, which he states is because the right wrist was injured more severely in the accident. The sensation radiates from the hands into the forearms and is equal bilaterally. The 4th and 5th fingers in the left hand and 3rd and 4th on the right-hand tingle. He states that his fingers are sore with palpation and seem weaker than before. Any exertion exacerbates the tingling, and after something exacerbates the pain, the tingling seems \"dull\". The symptoms come and go and seem to occur mostly at night. He denies complete loss of sensation in any of his fingers, but states that they seem less sensitive than they should be. He reports mild stiffness in his neck. He notes that he did hit his head during the car accident and was diagnosed with a contusion. He states that he has been given \"nerve pain medicine” but has not been taking it.\n\nHe currently takes Coreg for his hypertension and Lexapro for his anxiety. He reports a history of prediabetes, which he has brought under control via dietary changes.

    "system_output": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\nBilateral hand numbness and tingling\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\nShirley Taylor, a 60-year-old right-handed female, presents with bilateral hand numbness and tingling that began after a car accident in December 2020, where she broke both wrists. She initially noticed the symptoms more prominently after the healing process. The right wrist remains more affected, with associated mild neck stiffness and a history of a head contusion from the accident. She experiences the numbness and tingling primarily at night and intermittently throughout the day, with the right side extending from the middle and ring fingers up to the forearm, and the left side affecting the pinky and ring fingers. The symptoms are mostly sensory, with occasional pain and weakness, particularly during activities. She denies any significant loss of sensation but notes reduced sensitivity and mentions not consistently taking prescribed nerve pain medication. Her medical history includes chronic kidney disease, gout, hypertension, anxiety, GERD, and previously managed diabetes, now under control through dietary changes. She continues on carvedilol for hypertension and lexapro for anxiety, and has a known allergy to sulfa drugs.\n\nVITALS\nNot provided in the given information.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\nThe patient's physical examination revealed diminished pinprick sensation in the third and fourth fingers on the right and the fourth and fifth fingers on the left. Reflexes were one plus and symmetric, with two plus knee and toe reflexes bilaterally. Tinel's sign was positive at both wrists and elbows, indicating nerve irritation or entrapment.\n\nRESULTS\nNo specific lab results or imaging studies are mentioned in the provided notes.\n\nASSESSMENT\nThe assessment suggests bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, with a potential question of bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome. The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings support this diagnosis, with the exception of diminished sensation noted in certain fingers.\n\nPLAN\nThe patient was informed of the assessment and plans to schedule an electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) study. If symptoms persist or worsen despite conservative management, referral to a hand clinic for possible symptomatic injections or surgical intervention (carpal tunnel release) may be considered. The patient is advised to continue wearing her wrist splints and return for the EMG and NCV studies. No specific medications or additional treatments are mentioned in the provided notes.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nThe patient is instructed to continue wearing her wrist splints, prepare for upcoming EMG and NCV studies, and follow up with the healthcare provider for further evaluation and management of her symptoms. She should also adhere to her current medications for hypertension and anxiety and avoid sulfa-containing drugs due to her known allergy.  CHIEF COMPLAINT\nBilateral hand numbness and tingling\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\nShirley Taylor, a 60-year-old right-handed female, presents with bilateral hand numbness and tingling that began after a car accident in December 2020, where she broke both wrists. She initially noticed the symptoms more prominently after the healing process. The right wrist remains more affected, with associated mild neck stiffness and a history of a head contusion from the accident. She experiences the numbness and tingling primarily at night and intermittently throughout the day, with the right side extending from the middle and ring fingers up to the forearm, and the left side affecting the pinky and ring fingers. The symptoms are mostly sensory, with occasional pain and weakness, particularly during activities. She denies any significant loss of sensation but notes reduced sensitivity and mentions not consistently taking prescribed nerve pain medication. Her medical history includes chronic kidney disease, gout, hypertension, anxiety, GERD, and previously managed diabetes, now under control through dietary changes. She continues on carvedilol for hypertension and lexapro for anxiety, and has a known allergy to sulfa drugs.\n\nVITALS\nNot provided in the given information.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\nThe patient's physical examination revealed diminished pinprick sensation in the third and fourth fingers on the right and the fourth and fifth fingers on the left. Reflexes were one plus and symmetric, with two plus knee and toe reflexes bilaterally. Tinel's sign was positive at both wrists and elbows, indicating nerve irritation or entrapment.\n\nRESULTS\nNo specific lab results or imaging studies are",

She continues to wear a splint on the right wrist all the time and on the left only intermittently, which she states is because the right wrist was injured more severely in the MVA. The sensation radiates from the hands into the forearms and is equal bilaterally. The 4th and 5th fingers in the left hand and 3rd and 4th on the right-hand tingle. She states that her fingers are sore with palpation and seem weaker than before. Any exertion exacerbates the tingling, and after something exacerbates the pain, the tingling seems \"dull\". The symptoms come and go and seem to occur mostly at night. She denies complete loss of sensation in any of her fingers, but states that they seem less sensitive than they should be. she reports mild stiffness in her neck. She notes that she did hit her head during the MVA and was diagnosed with a contusion. She states that she has been given \"nerve pain medicine” but has not been taking it.\n\nThe patient takes carvedilol for her hypertension and Lexapro for her anxiety.

    "system_output": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\nAcute and chronic acid reflux\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\nMichelle King, a 35-year-old female, presents with a chief complaint of acute and chronic acid reflux. She reports experiencing heartburn, particularly in her chest and throat, which worsens on some days and improves on others. She has been taking 40 mg of omeprazole twice daily for approximately a year, but finds it ineffective on many occasions. Her symptoms began around age 12 and have progressively worsened over the past few years. She identifies trigger foods such as spicy foods, carbonated beverages, citrus, and tomato-based products, although she admits to not strictly avoiding them. She also mentions stress and anxiety as contributing factors. Michelle has a family history of gastrointestinal issues, including her mother who experienced acid reflux and underwent surgery for intestinal twisting during infancy. She denies any difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel movements, constipation, diarrhea, or rectal bleeding. Her weight has remained relatively stable, but she has lost some appetite over the past two months due to increased work stress. She has undergone an unspecified surgical procedure in her abdomen during infancy and has no recent history of upper endoscopies.\n\nVITALS\nNot provided in the given information.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\nThe physical examination reveals well-healed abdominal surgical scars from an early-life intestinal surgery. No other abnormalities are noted.\n\nRESULTS\nNo laboratory or imaging results are mentioned in the provided information.\n\nASSESSMENT\nMichelle King is diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), with a suspected functional component given her long-standing symptoms and partial response to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. The absence of significant weight loss, dysphagia, or other alarming symptoms is reassuring. Her family history of gastrointestinal issues, including her mother's acid reflux and her grandmother's esophageal cancer, suggests a possible genetic predisposition to GERD.\n\nPLAN\nThe management plan includes lifestyle modifications to avoid trigger foods and reduce stress. Michelle will be switched from omeprazole to nexium (esomeprazole) 40 mg twice daily. An upper endoscopy (EGD) will be performed to evaluate for potential causes of her GERD and to assess the mucosal integrity of the esophagus and stomach. Follow-up in the office after the EGD will be scheduled to discuss results and further management, which may include additional PPI trials or a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) challenge followed by a pH-impedance study if symptoms persist despite initial interventions.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nMichelle is advised to adhere to the prescribed medication regimen and to maintain a diary of her symptoms and dietary intake to identify further triggers. She should report any changes in her condition or adverse effects from the new medication to her healthcare provider immediately. She is instructed to follow up in the office for the EGD results and to continue monitoring her symptoms closely. If she experiences severe or worsening symptoms, she should seek immediate medical attention.

    "reference": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nAcid reflux.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMichelle King is a 35 y.o. female who presents to clinic today for a new patient evaluation of acid reflux. She was referred by her primary care physician, Dr. Scott.\n\nThe patient reports severe acid reflux that has increased in severity in recent years. She explains that she has struggled with acid reflux since approximately age 12 and she describes a burning sensation in her chest that travels up her esophagus. She denies any dysphagia, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, changes in bowel movements, constipation, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. She also denies any unintentional weight loss, although she admits to having a poor appetite due to her being under immense stress for the past 2 months. She has identified triggers for her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, soda, and citrus or tomato-based products. She admits that she does still eat her trigger foods sometimes despite the exacerbation of her symptoms.\n\nMs. King has been taking omeprazole 40 mg twice daily for approximately 1 year. She believes that the use of omeprazole provides some relief of her symptoms as there are some days when she is asymptomatic. The only other medication she has tried is ranitidine which she took concurrently with omeprazole and she believes this helped. The patient denies undergoing an EGD within the last 10 years.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nAnxiety.\n\nSurgical\nSurgery as an infant for “twisted intestines.”\n\nProcedures\nPossible EGD in youth, but none in the last 10 years.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nWorks as a paralegal.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nMaternal grandmother with esophageal cancer.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nOmeprazole 40 mg twice daily.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nSeasonal environmental allergies.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n• Constitutional Symptoms:  Positive for loss of appetite.\n• Gastrointestinal: Negative for constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, nausea, vomiting, blood in stools, unexplained change in bowel habits. Positive for heartburn.\n• Psychiatric:  Positive for stress and anxiety.\n• Allergic/Immunologic:  Positive for seasonal allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGastrointestinal\nThere is a well-healed abdominal surgical scar.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nThe patient presents today with a several year history of GERD that primarily manifests as heartburn and has been poorly controlled with omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I suspect that she likely has GERD with underlying functional etiology as well. Reassuringly, she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia. The patient has been able to identify triggers of her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, carbonated beverages, citrus, and tomato-based foods.\n\n• GERD\n• Suspected underlying functional etiology of heartburn.\n\nPLAN\n\n• I recommended dietary and lifestyle modifications like cutting out her known trigger foods and trying to reduce her stress levels to help with her symptoms.\n• I prescribed Nexium 40 mg twice daily to replace her current omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I sent this prescription to her pharmacy.\n• I also recommended she undergo an EGD. We discussed the potential risks of an endoscopic procedure. The patient understands the risks and is agreeable with the plan. She scheduled this procedure today.\n• If her EGD is normal and her symptoms persist despite a trial of Nexium, we can consider a trial of Protonix and obtain a pH impedance study. This will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity.\n• The patient was counselled to call my office if anything changes or if she has any problems before her EGD or follow-up appointment.\n• She will follow up with me in clinic after her EGD to discussed results and provide an update on the Nexium.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n• Avoid trigger foods and try to reduce stress levels.\n• Stop omeprazole 40 mg twice daily and start Nexium 40 mg twice daily instead.\n• Schedule EGD.\n• Call with any changes or problems.\n• Schedule a follow up visit after the EGD."

    "system_output": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\nThe patient presented with concerns regarding her recent hospitalization, specifically questioning whether it was due to a urinary tract infection or more likely related to her constipation and dysreflexia associated with her quadriplegia. She also expressed hesitancy about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, citing concerns about unknown side effects and vaccine injuries.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\nMichelle King, a 39-year-old female with a history of quadriplegia due to a prior spinal cord injury, was admitted to the hospital with increasing spasms, lightheadedness, significant constipation, and diaphoresis. Upon evaluation, she was found to be febrile with a markedly elevated white blood cell count (23,000), leading to initial concerns for a urinary tract infection. However, she was treated with IV antibiotics and showed gradual improvement. Despite negative urine cultures, she attributed her symptoms to constipation and dysreflexia, which she believed led to her hospitalization. She reported feeling much better after passing a large stool at home and requested reassurance about her condition.\n\nVITALS\nNo specific vital signs were mentioned in the conversation.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\nThe physical examination focused on assessing Michelle's general condition and bowel function. She reported no pain or discomfort. The conversation did not provide detailed findings from a formal physical examination.\n\nRESULTS\nLaboratory results included a white blood cell count of 23,000, which was elevated but not indicative of a urinary tract infection according to the urine cultures. Imaging studies (x-rays) were performed but not described in detail. No other specific test results were mentioned.\n\nASSESSMENT\nThe assessment concluded that Michelle's symptoms were likely exacerbated by dehydration and constipation rather than a urinary tract infection. Her elevated white blood cell count was attributed to inflammation possibly related to bowel issues. The conversation highlighted the need for further evaluation in a few weeks to ensure normalization of her white blood cell count and to rule out ongoing bowel inflammation.\n\nPLAN\nThe plan included scheduling a follow-up appointment in two to three weeks for comprehensive blood work, including a complete blood count (CBC) and a lipid profile, to monitor her white blood cell count and overall health. The doctor also discussed the importance of maintaining adequate hydration and bowel management with her current regimen of miralax and lactulose. The conversation ended with a discussion about the COVID-19 vaccine, where the doctor emphasized the safety and necessity of vaccination for individuals with underlying conditions like quadriplegia, despite the patient's hesitancy and concerns about side effects.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nMichelle was instructed to continue her current bowel management routine and to stay hydrated. She was advised to return in two to three weeks for further evaluation and to discuss her COVID-19 vaccination decision with the healthcare provider. The patient expressed satisfaction with the conversation and felt informed about her condition and treatment options.",

i really do n't think it was a uti .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] i told them when i went to the er ... is that your phone ?\n[doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on .\n[patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , \" no , \" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .\n[doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high .\n[patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?\n[doctor] typically , it does n't .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive .\n[patient] yeah , that's what they said .\n[doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ...\n[patient] hm .\n[doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] uh , they did n't do a cat scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ?\n[patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .\n[doctor] mm-hmm .\n[patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .\n[doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in .\n[patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .\n[doctor] well , maybe that's all it was .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ?\n[patient] yes , i am .\n[doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] great . so here are my thoughts .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ?\n[patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .\n[doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues .\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ?\n[patient] sure , i can do that .\n[doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels .\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see .\n[patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .\n[doctor] yeah .\n[patient] when i do n't go , i double up on that .\n[doctor] have i ever given

, yes . i have it . it takes about two days to work and then it's a brutal two days .\n[doctor] got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] all right . so we have our plan . any questions ?\n[patient] yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid , if we can .\n[doctor] sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ?\n[patient] i am unvaccinated .\n[doctor] so what are your concerns about the vaccine ?\n[patient] well , we do n't know the side effects .\n[doctor] correct , we do n't .\n[patient] it's too soon to tell the side effects , and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as \" vaccine injury \" .\n[doctor] right .\n[patient] which i had never heard of before . i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to beat it , even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c.\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] i also take multivitamins and i'm closely monitored . so i guess i do n't feel as though i really the vaccine .\n[doctor] well , my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid it's not going to be good for you .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and i think it's safe . i mean , i understand and hear you . all of these stories out there about this , uh , regarding the vaccine . but i've seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice , and i do n't disagree that if you got covid you'd probably be okay .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i have had healthy people die from covid .\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] i've had some people get really , really sick from it . so personally , i believe that this vaccine is completely safe . i really think that .\n[patient] all of them ?\n[doctor] yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines , so you have to go back and think about it . do you get flu shot every year ?\n[patient] no , i do n't .\n[doctor] right , well , it's hard for me to convince you because you're making a consistent viewpoint .\n[patient] well , i am open-minded to this .\n[doctor] mm-hmm . to me , it's , you know , a lot of the stuff out there is fear and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine . we've seen what the virus can do . i also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so i'm not concerned about the side effects of this . i do n't think it does anything . um , and we have vaccinated 50 % of the country .\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] the er is full of these vaccines .\n[patient] i understand .\n[doctor] so there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine . i mean , there's guillain-barre , and all these things that could happen from the vaccine , but they're just very rare . my thing for you is i'm not convinced that there's alternative stuff or even the treatment we have , like the monoclonal antibodies , that will give help , but it's just my opinion .\n[patient] well , that's what i'm here for .\n[doctor] yeah . right now the numbers are low . even with the delta variant , when it starts mutating , it's actually good because it becomes more contagious , but less deadly .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so that's what's gon na happen with covid . that's what's mo- most of the science supports and this is how most pandemics end , is that the virus starts losing its potency .\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] but think about it , and if you have any more questions you can certainly let me know , okay ?\n[patient] will do .\n[doctor] all right . anything else we can discuss today ?\n[patient] nope . i think i'm all set . thank you .\n[doctor] you're welcome . so we'll see you in two to three weeks . have a good rest of your day .\n[patient] thanks , you too .\n[doctor] next line heading will be \" acute to chronic constipation \" . she believes her hospitalization was more likely due to her dysreflexia , from her quadriplegia that typically occurs . she did have a lot of vital signs changes , including blood pressure fluctuations . the patient feels like she has a good bowel regimen , including taking the miralax regularly as a primary treatment for constipation issues as well as lactulose for severe constipation . she feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection and was just related to her constipation . however , we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis .\n[doctor] i would recommend just in the next three or four weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs , and we'll repeat the cbc just to make sure her white blood cells tend downward . uh , next line and heading will be \" quadriplegia \" . um , next line and heading will be \" covid vaccine status \" . again , she's hesitant . we had a good

    "reference": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nTransition of care visit.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMichelle King is a 39-year-old female who presents for a transition care visit. She was admitted to District Regional Hospital on 06/29/2021 and discharged on 07/02/2021.\n\nThe patient has a history quadriplegia from a prior spinal cord injury. She reported an increased concern for spasms, lightheadedness, headaches, significant constipation, and diaphoresis. Due to her uncontrolled blood pressure, headaches, and vomiting, she was evaluated in the emergency department. She was noted to be febrile, had a significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000, and labile blood pressure. Cultures were obtained and reviewed, with a urinary tract infection suspected. To note, the patient does require use of a suprapubic catheter. She was provided IV antibiotic therapy and was discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms.\n\nToday, the patient states she is feeling good and claims that she does not think she had an infection. Instead, she believes she was just constipated and that was the cause of her elevated blood pressure. She states she did not have a bowel movement in the hospital and when she got home, she had a large bowel movement and felt better. She states that she told the medical team in the emergency room that she was constipated, but they did not feel that was the causative agent, although they did complete x-rays and additional tests. The patient reports taking MiraLAX consistently for her constipation and Lactulose as needed, which takes 2 days produce a bowel movement.\n\nThe patient has not received the COVID-19 vaccinations because she does not know the side effects. She reports taking vitamin C and a multivitamin and she does not feel the need for the vaccine even though her “respiratory status is limited”. The patient also denies receiving the flu vaccine.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nQuadriplegia.\nSpinal cord injury.\nHypertension.\nChronic constipation.\nAutomatic dysreflexia.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nMiraLAX as needed by mouth.\nLactulose as needed by mouth.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n• Acute to chronic constipation.\n• Quadriplegia.\n\nPLAN\n\nAcute to chronic constipation\nShe believes that her hospitalization was more likely due to her constipation and dysreflexia from her quadriplegia. She had a lot of vital sign changes including blood pressure fluctuations. She feels like she has got a good bowel regimen. She does take MiraLAX consistently, and Lactulose for severe constipation. She feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection. However, we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis. I would recommend in the next 3 or 4 weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs and we will repeat the CBC and ensure that trends downwards.\n\nCOVID vaccine status\nAgain, she is hesitant. We had a good discussion. I recommend that the only real, true preventative mechanism for COVID is the vaccine. I do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off. I would be concerned that she does not get vaccinated, I would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status. She does not want to get COVID. However, she needs to make these decisions. She is somewhat homeopathic in some of her viewpoints.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nLabs pending at the time of discharge have been reviewed. Follow-up labs and appointments have been ordered.\n"

    "system_output": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\nAbnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\nAshley James, a 14-year-old female with no prior medical history, presented for evaluation of an abnormal renal ultrasound revealing an atrophic right kidney. She initially experienced severe abdominal pain on the right side, leading to multiple visits to healthcare providers due to persistent symptoms including vomiting and pain. Ultrasound findings also indicated cysts on the right kidney and ovaries, along with swollen lymph nodes suggesting an infection. Previous episodes of severe infections at age four required hospitalization, potentially affecting her kidney function. Family history includes renal disease in her father, aunt, and cousins, as well as breast cancer in her mother.\n\nVITALS\nNot provided in the transcript.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\nAshley appeared well-appearing, alert, and oriented. Physical examination revealed normothermia, normal lung and heart sounds, and no acute distress. The right kidney appeared atrophic compared to the left, which was slightly enlarged. No other abnormalities noted.\n\nRESULTS\nUltrasound showed an atrophic right kidney and cysts on the right kidney and ovaries. Blood tests and genetic panels were negative for significant mutations. Kidney function tests and blood pressure were within normal limits.\n\nASSESSMENT\nAshley has an atrophic right kidney likely secondary to chronic kidney disease, possibly due to a severe infection at age four. Family history of renal disease suggests a genetic predisposition. No evidence of systemic infection or genetic mutations was found.\n\nPLAN\nRecommend annual monitoring with ultrasound to assess kidney size and function, routine urinalysis to check for proteinuria or hematuria, and avoidance of NSAIDs in favor of acetaminophen. Encourage hydration with at least 2 liters of water daily and maintain a healthy diet. Follow-up with a primary care physician or adult nephrologist closer to home for ongoing management. Educate on the importance of staying hydrated during physical activities like softball and drill team participation.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nContinue current medications (Pepcid and Claritin). Avoid NSAIDs; use acetaminophen for pain relief. Ensure adequate hydration by drinking at least 2 liters of water daily. Maintain a healthy diet and active lifestyle. Monitor for worsening symptoms and contact healthcare provider if needed. Schedule follow-up appointments as recommended.",

doing that got us here , uh , today .\n[patient_guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] we automatically thought appendix .\n[doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense .\n[patient_guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .\n[doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ?\n[patient_guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient_guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .\n[doctor] wow . okay .\n[patient_guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .\n[doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ?\n[patient_guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .\n[doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ?\n[patient_guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .\n[doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel .\n[patient_guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .\n[doctor] mhm . okay .\n[patient_guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .\n[doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ?\n[patient_guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .\n[doctor] got you . okay .\n[patient_guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .\n[doctor] hmm . okay .\n[patient_guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .\n[doctor] yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ?\n[patient_guest] only pepcid .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient_guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .\n[doctor] all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ?\n[patient_guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .\n[doctor] great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ?\n[patient_guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .\n[doctor] okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ?\n[patient_guest] yes , that is correct . he did .\n[doctor] okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ?\n[patient_guest] yes , and they did n't catch it in time .\n[doctor] i'm so sorry to hear that .\n[patient_guest] yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .\n[doctor] my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care .\n[patient_guest] you're welcome .\n[doctor] okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ?\n[patient_guest] yes . well , it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt .\n[doctor] okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned .\n[patient_guest] um , this is what she sent me , \" end-stage renal disease . chronic kidney disease stage five , diabetes , hypertension . \" that's all i have , uh , to work on for her .\n[doctor] okay . uh , and that's ... okay . let me see . that is all when ... she was an adult when all of that happened ?\n[patient_guest] correct . yep .\n[doctor] all right-y . okay . and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist , where they did n't find anything sig ... clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did .\n[patient_guest] yes .\n[doctor] okay . so that's all good . so , ashley , um , a few questions for you if that's all right . how are you feeling right now ?\n[patient] i'm not feeling too bad . my stomach just hurts just a little bit . it's burning a little bit .\n[doctor] okay . and any pain when you go pee ?\n[patient] sometimes it's just hard to start , sometimes .\n[doctor] okay . and any blood in your pee ?\n[patient] no , not that i've noticed .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient_guest] she does complain that it burns when she pees when she drinks certain drinks , um , like , soda . so she'll only drink gatorade or water .\n[doctor] okay . yeah . so we do see that some people are very sensitive when the drink certain items , especially the carbonation . um , it can make it burn a little bit when they urinate . um ... okay . so a lot of different pictures of her kidneys here , and we'll review all of that here in a moment . um-\n[patient_guest] okay .\n[doctor] all right-y . but before we review that , i wan na look through a quick exam , uh , and just see how things are doing . you'll hear me speak aloud the exam just to make sure i'm getting everything documented .\n[patient_guest] okay .\n[doctor] all right-y . please use my physical exam template . so , ashley , i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart , if you'll just breathe normally for me . okay ?\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] good . lungs and heart sound great . all right-y . so your physical exam , you know , everything we see up here is ... you know , you're a well-appearing female , alert and oriented , sitting comfortably on my chair today , i hope , uh , with not acute distress . exam , um , otherwise with norm ... within normal limits . okay . so where does that all leave us ? the good news is that her kidney functions do look good as- as does her blood pressure . we'll wan na keep on eye on both of those things , as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call proteinuria , which is where your kidneys do n't work as well as they should and we end of seeing protein in your pee .\n[patient_guest] okay .\n[doctor] or , excuse me , her pee . uh , her right kidney is a little bit smaller which is making her left kidney work harder , possibly causing the left to appear bigger , um , and it's something that we wan na keep an eye on but nothing for us to do with anything today .\n[patient_guest] okay . thank you .\n[doctor] i also recommend that , on an annual basis , we do kind of the following things . so i wan na have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function , complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her ... in her pee , and do a blood pressure check . additionally , let's avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt to use tylenol instead .\n[patient_guest] okay . that sounds good .\n[doctor] okay . and does ashley play any sports ?\n[patient_guest] yes . she is active in softball and she wants to join the drill team over the summer .\n[doctor] how fun . i used to play softball back in the day . um , so it'll be very important that during those activities she stays well-hydrated . i really wan na avoid dehydration , as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys . so i'm gon na recommend at least two liters per day of water .\n[patient_guest] okay . great . we will work on that .\n[doctor] okay . i also recommended a healthy diet and continue her active lifestyle . this will help keep her and her kidneys healthier as an adult . so if we can start those behaviors early , we'll be in a good space as she progresses .\n[patient_guest] we can do that . we already do try to eat , uh , very well .\n[doctor] good . good . so for her next appointment , she can either meet with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to you guys at home . you do n't have come all the way out here .\n[patient_guest] okay . that sounds great .\n[doctor] okay . that was a lot . do we need any additional questions clarified or anything ? um , you can always give us or your primary a call if you think of anything or if ... certainly , if symptoms worse .\n[patient_guest] no . i do n't have any additional questions , and i'll- i'll definitely give you a- a phone call if we do . and thank you so much . this was so helpful .\n[doctor] awesome . well , thank you guys for making the trip . and , ashley , it was really nice to meet you . mom dad , you as well . and i hope you guys take care .\n[patient_guest] you too .\n[doctor] all right-y . past medical history , review of patient's grandfather's record , we see he had posterior urethral bowels valves and obstructive neur- neuropathy . uh , he developed chronic kidney disease and was on dial ... was dialysis-dependent . he had a renal transplant which subsequently failed , died of dialysis in his 40s . , wait . is that right ?\n[patient_guest] now that you've started , it does ... i do n't understand the he unless they were giving ... , the grandfather's record . but did you wan na do this on your own this recording ?\n[doctor] yeah . that's ... yeah . that'll work 'cause i'm gon na have to drop for this . but i think we're good for everything else .\n[patient] and he did die in his 40s . that's what it said in the note earlier .\n[doctor] okay . yeah . he died in his 40s , but i thought it was from a massive heart attack . died at 47 of a massive heart-\n[patient] he died ... it- it's saying that it meant ... it means he died on dia ... like , he was ... he was , um , utilizing dialysis .\n[doctor] not because of it . okay .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] i see what you're saying .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] got it . cool . i'm gon na stop-",
    "reference": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nEvaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nNext patient Ashley James is a 14-year-old female, previously healthy, who is here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.\n\nThe father details a history of the patient coming home sick one day with extreme right-sided abdominal pain. Her parents brought her for evaluation, and they treated her for a stomach virus and administered fluids prior to sending her home. The next day, the patient's pain was more severe. The patient returned to the doctor's office and an ultrasound and additional testing was performed which revealed left kidney hypertrophy. At that time, they were encouraged to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was seen briefly by her physician the next day, which was insignificant. Ashley was still experiencing stomach pain and vomiting, her father brought her to another facility in Jacksonville. At that location, the patient's family received information that her right kidney was nonfunctioning, atrophic, and smaller than her left kidney. Additionally, cysts on her kidneys, ovaries, and other locations were found. Her lymph nodes were swollen, and she had \"a lot of infections\". The patient was sent back to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was unable to follow back up with her primary care physician as he was still out of town. The patient came to Atlanta, remained here for 4 days, was evaluated and treated with subsequent improvement of her symptoms. She has not vomited since.\n\nPrior to her current medical complaints, the patient was healthy. The etiology of her kidney issues is believed to have been caused by some severe infection the patient experienced, possibly as a child.\n\nWhen the patient was 4 years old, she was hospitalized 3 or 4 times, for up to 2-3 days each time. She received fluids and antibiotics, and then discharged. Her father reports that no workup was ever performed to rule out infections during these hospitalizations. A week or 2 post-discharge the fever and symptoms would return. This kept recurring for approximately 2 months and then it spontaneously resolved.\n\nThe patient is still experiencing some stomach burning. She reports hesitancy while urinating and she states she has to wait for her urinary flow to commence. She endorses occasional dysuria. Ashley denies hematuria. Some beverages are associated with dysuria, thus the patient drinks mainly water, Gatorade and V8 juice.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient plays on softball team and is interested in joining a drill team over the summer.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nPaternal Grandfather: Deceased approximately 47. Myocardial Infarction. Posterior Urethral Valves. Obstructive Neuropathy. End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease was Dialysis dependent. Failed Renal Transplant.\nPaternal Great Aunt: End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease is Dialysis dependent. Type II Diabetes. Hypertension.\n\nNo family history of polycystic kidney disease.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nPepcid 40 mg once daily.\nClaritin as needed for allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nConstitutional\nWell-appearing female adolescent, sitting comfortably on the exam table in no acute distress.\n\nNeurological\nAlert.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAbdominal ultrasound, 03/22/2021.\nCT abdomen and pelvis, 03/22/2021.\nCMP, 03/22/2021.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n• Renal hypoplasia.\nAshley is a 14-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney. She has right-sided renal hypoplasia with a small atrophic right kidney discovered incidentally on imaging for abdominal pain. Imaging shows compensatory hypertrophy of her left kidney. Otherwise, she shows no sequelae of chronic kidney disease and enjoys normal blood pressure. Her urinalysis is without sediment. She has normal kidney function with creatinine of 0.62, which equates to an estimated GFR of greater than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m², and normal serum electrolytes and acid base status. Ashley is at higher risk of hypertension and proteinuria, which will need to be followed annually.\n\nPLAN\n\nYearly ultrasound to monitor the hypertrophic left kidney and atrophic right kidney. Also, on an annual basis I recommend completion of a urinalysis to assess for proteinuria and blood pressure checks. The patient should avoid use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and use Tylenol for pain and fever. It is also recommended that she stay well hydrated, avoiding dehydration, especially while participating in sports, by consuming 2 L of water per day. I counseled the patient and family about the importance of a healthy diet and remaining active to avoid future comorbidities that may put her at increased risk for chronic kidney disease as in adult.\n\nThe patient does not need to follow up with a pediatric nephrologist but can instead follow up with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to home.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nSchedule follow up appointment with local adult nephrologist or primary care physician."

Other than spontaneous flare-ups, his pain is worsened with excessive spinal flexion. Stretching and ibuprofen 800 mg daily are helpful, but he denies having tried icing the area.\n\nSURGICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient is status post lumbar microdiscectomy performed in 11/2020.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nThe patient reports that, prior to his microdiscectomy in 2020, he was taking high-dose gabapentin for severe nerve pain through his back and lower extremities. He is currently taking ibuprofen 800 mg daily.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports left-sided low back pain.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No pain with flexion or extension. Pain with weight-bearing. Pain with palpation on the left side around L5. No pain with palpation on the right side. Dorsiflexion is normal. Normal range of motion. No nerve pain in his lower extremities.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-ray images of the lumbar spine were obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or other abnormalities in the spine or vertebrae. His previous surgical site is visible and appears to have healed properly.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLow back pain, left side.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I believe his symptoms are related to a muscle strain due to spinal misalignment. I recommend that we treat the patient conservatively with formal physical therapy and meloxicam. The patient requested a prescription for Vicodin and Demerol. I explained that Vicodin is a strong medication for this issue and that I would need to refer him to pain management for that, but I did provide him with a prescription for Demerol."
