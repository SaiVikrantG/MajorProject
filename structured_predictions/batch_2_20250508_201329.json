She denies increasing glimepiride to 4 mg twice a day as advised but confirms she is compliant with 2 mg twice a day. She mostly denies reducing sugar and carbohydrate intake, although she opts for wheat bread, she does not have pasta at home, and she does not drink much soda and instead drinks club soda or seltzer water. She reports that her diabetic eye exams are up to date and she follows with Dr. Sanchez at Optimum Optometrists. She recently underwent cataract surgery and received a new prescription for her glasses, noting improvement in her vision to one eye and displeasure with the lens in her other eye.\n\nShe confirms compliancy with her blood pressure medications of metoprolol 50 mg daily, lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/25 mg daily, and amlodipine 10 mg daily. The patient intermittently completes at home blood pressure checks and reported seeing a systolic BP of 116 a few weeks ago. She is also compliant with her atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia and reports tolerating it well.\n\nThe patient is still experiencing bilateral hip, thigh, and foot pain related to peripheral neuropathy, noting her mobility is limited but she is walking as tolerated.\n\nMs. Martin does continue to smoke cigarettes and denies interest in cessation, although she agreed to begin thinking about it.\n\nShe is currently experiencing a productive cough with clear sputum that she attributes to her recent congestion.\n\nThe patient is also experiencing a slower urine stream, but it appears stable, and she contributes her urinary symptoms to aging. She also has nocturia on occasion which she contributes to her increased fluid intake in the evenings.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nType 2 diabetes mellitus.\nHypertension.\nHyperlipidemia.\nPeripheral vascular disease with neuropathy.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nCurrent tobacco smoker.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nMetoprolol 50 mg tablet.

I counselled patient on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, although I don\u2019t think she is at a great risk of hypoglycemia. There will be no change to her metformin dose. I counselled the patient on limiting her carbohydrate intake to support improved glycemia. We will recheck her Hemoglobin A1c and complete a kidney function test today.\n\nPeripheral vascular disease\nI counselled patient on improving frequency of moisturizing her feet. Improved glycemia would also benefit her neuropathy. If symptoms worsen, we will consider medication to control symptoms, but not at this time due to the patient has already reached polypharmacy.\n\nHypertension\nBlood pressure appears to be well controlled based on checks completed at home. The patient will continue with amlodipine, metoprolol, and lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide.\n\nHyperlipidemia\nI will continue with atorvastatin as previously prescribed. If patient were to improve her diet, this would likely be beneficial as well.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFinish current prescription of glimepiride 2 mg, 2 tablets 2 times per day. Refill will be 4 mg tablet, 1 tablet 2 times per day. Reduce carbohydrate intake overall to improve glycemia. Call the office with questions or any signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia.\n",
    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nNumbness and tingling of both hands.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nElijah Cook is a 60-year-old male referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling of both hands.\n\nThe patient complains of numbness, tingling, and pain in both hands which began in 12/2019 after he broke both wrists in a motor vehicle accident and which has progressively worsened since then. He continues to wear a splint on the right wrist all the time and on the left only intermittently, which he states is because the right wrist was injured more severely in the accident. The sensation radiates from the hands into the forearms and is equal bilaterally. The 4th and 5th fingers in the left hand and 3rd and 4th on the right-hand tingle. He states that his fingers are sore with palpation and seem weaker than before. Any exertion exacerbates the tingling, and after something exacerbates the pain, the tingling seems \"dull\". The symptoms come and go and seem to occur mostly at night. He denies complete loss of sensation in any of his fingers, but states that they seem less sensitive than they should be. He reports mild stiffness in his neck. He notes that he did hit his head during the car accident and was diagnosed with a contusion. He states that he has been given \"nerve pain medicine\u201d but has not been taking it.\n\nHe currently takes Coreg for his hypertension and Lexapro for his anxiety. He reports a history of prediabetes, which he has brought under control via dietary changes. He denies any history of thyroid issues.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Constitutional Symptoms: Easily fatigued, weight gain.\n\u2022 Eyes: Floaters.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Bilateral peripheral edema.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Shortness of breath.\n\u2022 Gastrointestinal: Excessive appetite, abdominal bloating.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Gout, muscle pain.\n\u2022 Integumentary: Dry itchy skin, nail bed changes.\n\u2022 Endocrine: Excessive hunger.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNeurological\nPinprick sensation intact in the 3rd and 4th fingers on the right hand and 4th and 5th fingers on the left hand. Reflexes are 1+ and symmetric, 2+ knees. Toes down going bilaterally. Tinel\u2019s sign positive at both wrists and elbows.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome\nMr. Cook is a 60-year-old male referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling of both hands. His symptom presentation and exam findings today suggest this is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or, potentially, this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome.\n\nPLAN\n\nDiagnosis discussed with patient, I explained that the nerves in his wrists are aggravated by the past trauma causing the pain and tingling. Further testing is indicated to measure the responsiveness of the nerves to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from. We will plan for a follow-up visit after the EMG testing is performed. If still symptomatic, we can consider a referral to our Hand Clinic possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release surgery. We could also refer to an orthopedist for the same treatment.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFollow-up after EMG testing."
