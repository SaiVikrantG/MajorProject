      "CHIEF COMPLAINT": "Bilateral hand numbness and tingling",
      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS": "Shirley Taylor, a 60-year-old right-handed female, presents with bilateral hand numbness and tingling that began after a car accident in December 2020, where she broke both wrists. She initially noticed the symptoms more prominently after the healing process. The right wrist remains more affected, with associated mild neck stiffness and a history of a head contusion from the accident. She experiences the numbness and tingling primarily at night and intermittently throughout the day, with the right side extending from the middle and ring fingers up to the forearm, and the left side affecting the pinky and ring fingers. The symptoms are mostly sensory, with occasional pain and weakness, particularly during activities. She denies any significant loss of sensation but notes reduced sensitivity and mentions not consistently taking prescribed nerve pain medication. Her medical history includes chronic kidney disease, gout, hypertension, anxiety, GERD, and previously managed diabetes, now under control through dietary changes. She continues on carvedilol for hypertension and lexapro for anxiety, and has a known allergy to sulfa drugs.",
      "VITALS": "Not provided in the given information.",
      "PHYSICAL EXAM": "The patient's physical examination revealed diminished pinprick sensation in the third and fourth fingers on the right and the fourth and fifth fingers on the left. Reflexes were one plus and symmetric, with two plus knee and toe reflexes bilaterally. Tinel's sign was positive at both wrists and elbows, indicating nerve irritation or entrapment.",
      "RESULTS": "No specific lab results or imaging studies are",
      "ASSESSMENT": "The assessment suggests bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, with a potential question of bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome. The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings support this diagnosis, with the exception of diminished sensation noted in certain fingers.",
      "PLAN": "The patient was informed of the assessment and plans to schedule an electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) study. If symptoms persist or worsen despite conservative management, referral to a hand clinic for possible symptomatic injections or surgical intervention (carpal tunnel release) may be considered. The patient is advised to continue wearing her wrist splints and return for the EMG and NCV studies. No specific medications or additional treatments are mentioned in the provided notes.",
      "INSTRUCTIONS": "The patient is instructed to continue wearing her wrist splints, prepare for upcoming EMG and NCV studies, and follow up with the healthcare provider for further evaluation and management of her symptoms. She should also adhere to her current medications for hypertension and anxiety and avoid sulfa-containing drugs due to her known allergy.  CHIEF COMPLAINT\nBilateral hand numbness and tingling"

      "CHIEF COMPLAINT": "Acute and chronic acid reflux",
      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS": "Michelle King, a 35-year-old female, presents with a chief complaint of acute and chronic acid reflux. She reports experiencing heartburn, particularly in her chest and throat, which worsens on some days and improves on others. She has been taking 40 mg of omeprazole twice daily for approximately a year, but finds it ineffective on many occasions. Her symptoms began around age 12 and have progressively worsened over the past few years. She identifies trigger foods such as spicy foods, carbonated beverages, citrus, and tomato-based products, although she admits to not strictly avoiding them. She also mentions stress and anxiety as contributing factors. Michelle has a family history of gastrointestinal issues, including her mother who experienced acid reflux and underwent surgery for intestinal twisting during infancy. She denies any difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel movements, constipation, diarrhea, or rectal bleeding. Her weight has remained relatively stable, but she has lost some appetite over the past two months due to increased work stress. She has undergone an unspecified surgical procedure in her abdomen during infancy and has no recent history of upper endoscopies.",
      "VITALS": "Not provided in the given information.",
      "PHYSICAL EXAM": "The physical examination reveals well",
      "RESULTS": "No laboratory or imaging results are mentioned in the provided information.",
      "ASSESSMENT": "Michelle King is diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), with a suspected functional component given her long-standing symptoms and partial response to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. The absence of significant weight loss, dysphagia, or other alarming symptoms is reassuring. Her family history of gastrointestinal issues, including her mother's acid reflux and her grandmother's esophageal cancer, suggests a possible genetic predisposition to GERD.",
      "PLAN": "The management plan includes lifestyle modifications to avoid trigger foods and reduce stress. Michelle will be switched from omeprazole to nexium (esomeprazole) 40 mg twice daily. An upper endoscopy (EGD) will be performed to evaluate for potential causes of her GERD and to assess the mucosal integrity of the esophagus and stomach. Follow-up in the office after the EGD will be scheduled to discuss results and further management, which may include additional PPI trials or a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) challenge followed by a pH-impedance study if symptoms persist despite initial interventions.",
      "INSTRUCTIONS": "Michelle is advised to adhere to the prescribed medication regimen and to maintain a diary of her symptoms and dietary intake to identify further triggers. She should report any changes in her condition or adverse effects from the new medication to her healthcare provider immediately. She is instructed to follow up in the office for the EGD results and to continue monitoring her symptoms closely. If she experiences severe or worsening symptoms, she should seek immediate medical attention.  CHIEF COMPLAINT\nAcute and chronic acid reflux"

    {
      "CHIEF COMPLAINT": "The patient presented with concerns regarding her recent hospitalization, specifically questioning whether it was due to a urinary tract infection or more likely related to her constipation and dysreflexia associated with her quadriplegia. She also expressed hesitancy about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, citing concerns about unknown side effects and vaccine injuries.",
      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS": "Michelle King, a 39-year-old female with a history of quadriplegia due to a prior spinal cord injury, was admitted to the hospital with increasing spasms, lightheadedness, significant constipation, and diaphoresis. Upon evaluation, she was found to be febrile with a markedly elevated white blood cell count (23,000), leading to initial concerns for a urinary tract infection. However, she was treated with IV antibiotics and showed gradual improvement. Despite negative urine cultures, she attributed her symptoms to constipation and dysreflexia, which she believed led to her hospitalization. She reported feeling much better after passing a large stool at home and requested reassurance about her condition.",
      "VITALS": "No specific vital signs were mentioned in the conversation.",
      "PHYSICAL EXAM": "The physical examination focused on assessing Michelle's general condition and bowel function. She reported no pain or discomfort. The conversation did not provide detailed findings from a formal physical examination.",
      "RESULTS": "Laboratory results included a white blood cell count of 23,000, which was elevated but not indicative of a urinary tract infection according to the urine cultures. Imaging studies (x-rays) were performed but not described in detail. No other specific test results were mentioned.",
      "ASSESSMENT": "The assessment concluded that Michelle's symptoms were likely exacerbated by dehydration and constipation rather than a urinary tract infection. Her elevated white blood cell count was attributed to inflammation possibly related to bowel issues. The conversation highlighted the need for further evaluation in a few weeks to ensure normalization of her white blood cell count and to rule out ongoing bowel inflammation.",
      "PLAN": "The plan included scheduling a follow-up appointment in two to three weeks for comprehensive blood work, including a complete blood count (CBC) and a lipid profile, to monitor her white blood cell count and overall health. The doctor also discussed the importance of maintaining adequate hydration and bowel management with her current regimen of miralax and lactulose. The conversation ended with a discussion about the COVID-19 vaccine, where the doctor emphasized the safety and necessity of vaccination for individuals with underlying conditions like quadriplegia, despite the patient's hesitancy and concerns about side effects.",
      "INSTRUCTIONS": "Michelle was instructed to continue her current bowel management routine and to stay hydrated. She was advised to return in two to three weeks for further evaluation and to discuss her COVID-19 vaccination decision with the healthcare provider. The patient expressed satisfaction with the conversation and felt informed about her condition and treatment options."

    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nUpper extremity tingling\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nThe patient is a 60-year-old female referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling.\n\nThe patient complains of numbness, tingling, and pain in both hands which began last December after she broke both wrists in an MVA and which has progressively worsened since then. She continues to wear a splint on the right wrist all the time and on the left only intermittently, which she states is because the right wrist was injured more severely in the MVA. The sensation radiates from the hands into the forearms and is equal bilaterally. The 4th and 5th fingers in the left hand and 3rd and 4th on the right-hand tingle. She states that her fingers are sore with palpation and seem weaker than before. Any exertion exacerbates the tingling, and after something exacerbates the pain, the tingling seems \"dull\". The symptoms come and go and seem to occur mostly at night. She denies complete loss of sensation in any of her fingers, but states that they seem less sensitive than they should be. she reports mild stiffness in her neck.

    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nAcid reflux.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMichelle King is a 35 y.o. female who presents to clinic today for a new patient evaluation of acid reflux. She was referred by her primary care physician, Dr. Scott.\n\nThe patient reports severe acid reflux that has increased in severity in recent years. She explains that she has struggled with acid reflux since approximately age 12 and she describes a burning sensation in her chest that travels up her esophagus. She denies any dysphagia, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, changes in bowel movements, constipation, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. She also denies any unintentional weight loss, although she admits to having a poor appetite due to her being under immense stress for the past 2 months. She has identified triggers for her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, soda, and citrus or tomato-based products. She admits that she does still eat her trigger foods sometimes despite the exacerbation of her symptoms.\n\nMs. King has been taking omeprazole 40 mg twice daily for approximately 1 year. She believes that the use of omeprazole provides some relief of her symptoms as there are some days when she is asymptomatic. The only other medication she has tried is ranitidine which she took concurrently with omeprazole and she believes this helped. The patient denies undergoing an EGD within the last 10 years.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nAnxiety.\n\nSurgical\nSurgery as an infant for \u201ctwisted intestines.\u201d\n\nProcedures\nPossible EGD in youth, but none in the last 10 years.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nWorks as a paralegal.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nMaternal grandmother with esophageal cancer.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nOmeprazole 40 mg twice daily.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nSeasonal environmental allergies.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022\u202fConstitutional Symptoms:\u202f Positive for loss of appetite.\n\u2022\u202fGastrointestinal:\u202fNegative for constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, nausea, vomiting, blood in stools, unexplained change in bowel habits. Positive for heartburn.\n\u2022\u202fPsychiatric:\u202f Positive for stress and anxiety.\n\u2022\u202fAllergic/Immunologic:\u202f Positive for seasonal allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGastrointestinal\nThere is a well-healed abdominal surgical scar.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nThe patient presents today with a several year history of GERD that primarily manifests as heartburn and has been poorly controlled with omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I suspect that she likely has GERD with underlying functional etiology as well. Reassuringly, she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia. The patient has been able to identify triggers of her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, carbonated beverages, citrus, and tomato-based foods.\n\n\u2022 GERD\n\u2022 Suspected underlying functional etiology of heartburn.\n\nPLAN\n\n\u2022 I recommended dietary and lifestyle modifications like cutting out her known trigger foods and trying to reduce her stress levels to help with her symptoms.\n\u2022 I prescribed Nexium 40 mg twice daily to replace her current omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I sent this prescription to her pharmacy.\n\u2022 I also recommended she undergo an EGD. We discussed the potential risks of an endoscopic procedure. The patient understands the risks and is agreeable with the plan. She scheduled this procedure today.\n\u2022 If her EGD is normal and her symptoms persist despite a trial of Nexium, we can consider a trial of Protonix and obtain a pH impedance study. This will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity.\n\u2022 The patient was counselled to call my office if anything changes or if she has any problems before her EGD or follow-up appointment.\n\u2022 She will follow up with me in clinic after her EGD to discussed results and provide an update on the Nexium.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n\u2022 Avoid trigger foods and try to reduce stress levels.\n\u2022 Stop omeprazole 40 mg twice daily and start Nexium 40 mg twice daily instead.\n\u2022 Schedule EGD.\n\u2022 Call with any changes or problems.\n\u2022 Schedule a follow up visit after the EGD.",
    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nTransition of care visit.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMichelle King is a 39-year-old female who presents for a transition care visit. She was admitted to District Regional Hospital on 06/29/2021 and discharged on 07/02/2021.\n\nThe patient has a history quadriplegia from a prior spinal cord injury. She reported an increased concern for spasms, lightheadedness, headaches, significant constipation, and diaphoresis. Due to her uncontrolled blood pressure, headaches, and vomiting, she was evaluated in the emergency department. She was noted to be febrile, had a significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000, and labile blood pressure. Cultures were obtained and reviewed, with a urinary tract infection suspected. To note, the patient does require use of a suprapubic catheter. She was provided IV antibiotic therapy and was discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms.\n\nToday, the patient states she is feeling good and claims that she does not think she had an infection. Instead, she believes she was just constipated and that was the cause of her elevated blood pressure. She states she did not have a bowel movement in the hospital and when she got home, she had a large bowel movement and felt better. She states that she told the medical team in the emergency room that she was constipated, but they did not feel that was the causative agent, although they did complete x-rays and additional tests. The patient reports taking MiraLAX consistently for her constipation and Lactulose as needed, which takes 2 days produce a bowel movement.\n\nThe patient has not received the COVID-19 vaccinations because she does not know the side effects. She reports taking vitamin C and a multivitamin and she does not feel the need for the vaccine even though her \u201crespiratory status is limited\u201d. The patient also denies receiving the flu vaccine.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nQuadriplegia.\nSpinal cord injury.\nHypertension.\nChronic constipation.\nAutomatic dysreflexia.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nMiraLAX as needed by mouth.\nLactulose as needed by mouth.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Acute to chronic constipation.\n\u2022 Quadriplegia.\n\nPLAN\n\nAcute to chronic constipation\nShe believes that her hospitalization was more likely due to her constipation and dysreflexia from her quadriplegia. She had a lot of vital sign changes including blood pressure fluctuations. She feels like she has got a good bowel regimen. She does take MiraLAX consistently, and Lactulose for severe constipation. She feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection. However, we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis. I would recommend in the next 3 or 4 weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs and we will repeat the CBC and ensure that trends downwards.\n\nCOVID vaccine status\nAgain, she is hesitant. We had a good discussion. I recommend that the only real, true preventative mechanism for COVID is the vaccine. I do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off. I would be concerned that she does not get vaccinated, I would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status. She does not want to get COVID. However, she needs to make these decisions. She is somewhat homeopathic in some of her viewpoints.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nLabs pending at the time of discharge have been reviewed. Follow-up labs and appointments have been ordered.\n",
