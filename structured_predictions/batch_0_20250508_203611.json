      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS": "The patient reports that while riding a tandem bike, they fell due to their partner's distraction, resulting in a direct impact with the curb. The right knee immediately became sore, prompting the application of ice, over-the-counter pain relief (ibuprofen), and a bandage.

      "CHIEF COMPLAINT": "Left elbow pain radiating to the neck, accompanied by intermittent chest pain.",
      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS": "- Patient Zachary presented with left elbow pain that started suddenly and has been persistent since waking up the previous day. Describes the pain as achy and heavy, extending from the elbow up to the neck. Pain is not localized to a specific area within the elbow but rather a general discomfort along the arm. Denies any recent unusual activities or injuries. Additionally, reports intermittent chest pain that began yesterday, associated with the arm pain, and occasionally radiates up to the neck. The chest pain is episodic, occurring a few times a day, and is not constant. Symptoms worsen with physical activities such as mowing grass.",

      "PHYSICAL EXAM": "- General appearance: Zachary appears uncomfortable but in no acute distress.\n- Cardiovascular: Slight murmur detected during auscultation.\n- Neurological: No focal deficits noted; sensation and motor function intact.\n- Musculoskeletal: Left elbow shows no visible swelling or deformity; range of motion limited due to pain.\n- Chest: No palpable masses or tenderness; respiratory sounds clear bilaterally.",
      "RESULTS": "- EKG pending.\n- Glucose test pending.\n- Blood",
      "ASSESSMENT": "Primary concerns include possible musculoskeletal injury to the left arm, given the sudden onset and nature of the pain. However, the presence of a new cardiac murmur and the association of arm pain with chest pain raise significant concern for a potential cardiac event, such as a myocardial infarction or angina. The intermittent nature of the chest pain and its relation to exertion further complicates the differential diagnosis.",
      "PLAN": "Immediate management includes administration of aspirin and nitroglycerin sublingually to alleviate symptoms and reduce the risk of thrombosis or vasospasm. An electrocardiogram (EKG) will be performed to assess for any ischemic changes indicative of a cardiac event. Pending EKG results, a decision will be made regarding the necessity of emergency department evaluation via 911. Given the patient's history of hypertension and diabetes, these conditions will be closely monitored and managed accordingly.",
      "INSTRUCTIONS": "Patient instructed to remain calm and avoid strenuous activity until further evaluation. To be contacted immediately if symptoms worsen or new symptoms appear, particularly if chest pain becomes more frequent, severe, or associated with shortness of breath. Follow-up appointment will be scheduled post-EKG results to discuss findings and adjust treatment plan as necessary. Patient advised to continue monitoring blood pressure at home and report any significant fluctuations. Diabetes management will be reviewed, emphasizing the importance of regular glucose monitoring and adherence to prescribed medications.

    "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nBeverly Howard is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right knee pain.\n\nThe patient reports that she fell off of a tandem bicycle and struck her right knee on a curb approximately 2 weeks ago. After the injury, she took ibuprofen and treated the wound, but the pain has persisted. She localizes her pain to the medial aspect of the knee. She also reports occasional clicking with full extension of the knee, as well as occasional instability with ambulation. The patient states that her pain is the worst when ambulating up an incline. She denies any previous right knee issues. She enjoys walking her dogs and swimming but has not done this since her injury.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient works in a Children's Hospital.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain, clicking, and instability.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nSKIN: Warm, dry and intact\nMSK: \nExamination of the right knee: Tenderness along the medial joint line. Pes bursa is nontender. The epicondyle and posterior aspect of her knee are soft. Popliteal space is nontender. The lateral aspect of her knee is nontender. There is a dime-sized abrasion that is dry and appears to be 1 week old, over the medial patella. No scars. Full extension. Full symmetric flexion. No deformity. Valgus stress of the medial and lateral collateral ligament are intact. Laxity with posterior drawer testing. 1+ posterior drawer test. Negative Lachman test. Patella tracks fine. No crepitus. Negative McMurray test.\nExamination of the left knee: Full symmetric flexion. No deformity. Valgus stress of the medial collateral ligament is intact. Lateral collateral ligament is intact.\n\nRESULTS\n\n4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or dislocations. Joint space is well preserved. No other abnormalities are noted.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight knee pain, possible posterior cruciate ligament sprain.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, we had a lengthy discussion in regard to her current symptoms. I explained that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I recommend we obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible posterior cruciate ligament injury. In the meantime, I have recommended that the patient be placed in a brace to provide increased support. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to work on her range of motion and strengthening. I advised her to ice her right knee a few times a day to reduce the swelling. She can continue taking her ibuprofen if she finds this helpful, but I am also going to send in a prescription medication she can take less frequently. The patient will follow up with me in 4 to 6 weeks to check on her progress.\n\nORDERS\n\nMRI, right knee\nPrescription medication",
