The headaches have been intermittent for about a month, accompanied by occasional dizziness, blurred vision, and a feeling of chest pain. Theressa admits to not taking her medication regularly, only every other day, and also admits to not adhering to a low-sodium diet, frequently consuming McDonald's, especially Flare of Fish. Her blood sugar levels have been elevated, with a reading of 170 mg/dL after fasting overnight.

    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nBack pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nSteven Reed is a pleasant 60-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of back pain. The onset of his pain began 2 years ago after he fell and landed onto his back while playing basketball. His pain is rated at 7 out of 10 and is described a sharp with occasional throbbing. At times his pain will radiate down his left lower extremity. He also reports experiencing intermittent numbness in his toes. Prolonged standing exacerbates his pain and makes him feel weak. He is able to get some pain relief when laying on his side. In terms of his bowel and bladder habits, he reports 1 episode of incontinence over the last 2 years which he believes was due to prolonged standing and possible alcohol consumption. He other denies any other changes and denies loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area. He has tried an injection in the past, but notes that he does not like needles and had to be held down. Pain medication was tried but he is unable to recall the name of the medication. He also attended physical therapy with minimal relief. Currently he states that he is not very active and tends to watch tv all day. He has gained 80 lbs over the last year.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports previously playing basketball, but he is now not very active and sits at home all day. He has a history of smoking, but denies smoking currently.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nPatient reports his 4th cousin has scoliosis.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nGenitourinary: Denies bowel or bladder changes.\nMusculoskeletal: Reports back pain.\n\nVITALS\n\nOxygen saturation is in 95 percentile range.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm. No Murmur.\nNEURO: Decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at the L4 dermatome. Patella and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical.\nMSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No overlying erythema or ecchymosis. Midline tenderness along the L4-5 disc space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness. Pain with lumbar flexion and extension. Positive supine straight leg raise.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe MRI of the lumbar spine was reviewed. This shows evidence of disc desiccation and a disc bulge with a paracentral disc herniation resulting in moderate right neural foraminal stenosis.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nChronic lumbar back pain.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and MRI findings today, I explained to the patient that he has a herniated disc at L4-5 with radiculopathy. We discussed the nature of the diagnosis as well as treatment options. I have recommended that we start with a spinal corticosteroid injection under fluoroscopy. The nature of the procedure was discussed. A prescription was given today to help with his anxiety during the injection as he states he does not tolerate needles. We also had a long discussion regarding pain medication. I advised him that we can do up to 4 injections per year and that we need to hold off on proceeding with pain medication until we assess his progress. I also explained to him that pain medication is not a long term solution and that if he remains symptomatic, it is possible surgery would be recommended.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will return for follow-up after to assess his progress after his spinal injection.\n",
    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight shoulder pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nSharon Wright is a pleasant 36-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right shoulder pain. The onset of her pain began 3 weeks ago, when she was painting on a ladder when she reached out to catch herself because she fell. She states that she braced herself with her right arm. The patient reports that she was able to get up and continue painting. She states that she experienced numbness and tingling in her arm and hand when she initially injured her right shoulder, however this has resolved. She states that she iced her arm and took Advil for pain. The patient denies any previous shoulder pain. She reports constant pain with lifting her arm overhead. The patient rates her pain level as a 6 out of 10 without medication and a 4 out of 10 with medication.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Positive right shoulder pain.\nNeurological: Denies numbness and tingling.\n\nVITALS\n\nVitals look good today.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Brisk capillary refill of less than 3 seconds.\nNEURO: Normal strength and sensation. Neurovascularly intact distally. Equal bilateral response to sensation and touch.\nMSK: Examination of the right shoulder reveals limited active and passive ROM. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness over the sternoclavicular joint. Good strong bilateral hand grips.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-ray of the right shoulder taken today reveals no fracture or bony abnormality.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight shoulder rotator cuff tendinopathy.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her symptoms are likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right shoulder. I referred her to formal physical therapy to strengthen her right shoulder. She will continue to take Advil as needed for pain.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks for re-evaluation.\n",
    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nVision changes in the right eye.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports history of high blood pressure.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports he is smoking 1 pack of cigarettes daily.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nEyes: Reports right eye vision changes.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nEyes\n- Examination of the right eye: Posterior chamber intraocular lenses present bilaterally. Right eye cornea is clear without NVI and cup-disc ratio is 0.2. Fundus of right eye shows retina is intact 360 degrees without holes or tears noted, and RPE changes in fovea. Posterior segment shows drusen of the macula, retinal thickening, and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation. Positive hemorrhage\nExamination of the left eye: Cornea is clear. No NVI. Cup-disc ration is 0.3. RPE changes in fovea. No hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted. Retina is attached appropriately.\n\nRESULTS\n\nOTC:\nDrusen deposits under the RPE. SRF accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized.\n\nFluorescein angiography:\nReveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neovascular age related macular degeneration.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\n1. Wet macular degeneration.\n- Medical Reasoning: The diagnostic test and eye exams are consistent with neovascular age-related macular degeneration, also called wet macular degeneration.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the nature of the diagnosis and that this is advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening. We discussed this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina leaking fluid and blood. Secondary to that, it creates a large blind spot in the center of his visual field. He was advised that this is the most common cause of severe vision loss. I explained the treatment plan at length. He understands he is going to be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye, so he is not going to feel any pain. I advised injections given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it. However, I also have to let him know that there could be a situation where he may still note a small amount of vision loss, but this is his best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as he can. Additionally, patient was counseled on the importance of taking his blood pressure medication. Questions were invited and answered today.\n- Medical Treatment: Lucentis injections once a month with his first being performed today.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."
